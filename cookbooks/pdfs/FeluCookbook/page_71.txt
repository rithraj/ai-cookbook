D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Cut the american cheese and mozzarella  
into small pieces.
2.	 Add evaporated milk and gochujang to a glass  
and mix until smooth.
3.	 Add the pasta to a cold pan (I use a 24cm or 9,5 inch pan). 
Place the pan on top of your stove and  
cover it with cold water until the pasta is covered.  
This should take around 500 g. 
4.	 Add a small pinch of salt.
5.	 Switch the heat to high and immediately start stirring the 
pasta every 20 seconds for the first 2 minutes. 
6.	 Once the water is boiling, turn the heat to  
medium-high and cook pasta al dente.
7.	 In the pan should be a bit of pasta water left.  
You can remove most of it in a separate glass.  
But don’t throw it away yet!
8.	 Add in the pan the cheese and gochujang and turn the heat 
to low. Slowly let everything melt into a thick cheese sauce. 
Add the pasta water back to the pan if it’s too thick. Keep 
slowly cooking for 2 minutes until fully melted. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 This pasta technique can be used for every pasta dish you 
make. The pasta water will be highly concentrated in starch, 
which will make every sauce better.
•	 You can add garlic and onion powder to the  
sauce for more flavor.
