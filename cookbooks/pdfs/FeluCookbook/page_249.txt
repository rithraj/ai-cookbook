 Cacciatore is the Italian word for 
 hunter. While I don’t know why, 
 the meal is amazing and great for  
 meal prep.

D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Cut chicken into large chunks. Season them with salt.
2.	 Chop up all vegetables into bitesize pieces.
3.	 Place a big pot on a stove on medium-high.  
Add oil and fry the chicken on both sides for  
30-40 seconds each sides until it gets color.
4.	 Remove chicken, and add mushrooms with  
50 g  water. Wait until the mushrooms collapse.  
Add 2 g oil to cover all mushrooms and fry  
them for 4-5 minutes until they get brown. 
5.	 Add all remaining vegetables and keep frying for 
another 5 minutes.
6.	 Add tomato puree and keep frying for 30 seconds. 
7.	 Then add in water with broth powder and stir every- 
thing. Add in crushed tomatoes as well.
8.	 Wait until the sauce starts to simmer,  
and add the chicken back (not the breast yet).  
Let the thighs simmer for 20-30 minutes.
9.	 Add in chicken breast for the last 5-8 minutes  
until the breast is cooked through.  
Add additional 50 g of olives (optional).
