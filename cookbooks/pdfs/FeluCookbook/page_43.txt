D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Place a bowl on a scale. Add in the flour, egg, milk, 
sweetener and a pinch of salt and whisk everything  
until smooth.
2.	 Combine the powdered peanuts with a splash of water 
and mix with a spoon. It should become a thick but still 
liquidy consistency. If it is too thick, add another splash 
of water and keep mixing.
3.	 Heat up a pan (24cm or 9.5 inch) to medium heat.  
Spray oil into the pan.
4.	 The batter will make 3-4 crepes. Take one serving  
 batter with a ladle and pour it into the pan. 
5.	 Start swirling around until the batter forms a round shape 
and covers the entire pan. It should look like a tortilla.
6.	 Let it cook for 30-45 seconds. Try to loosen the bottom 
with a spatula and flip the crepe. It should be firm now, 
so it won’t break.
7.	 Cook under occasional flipping for 2-3 minutes in total. 
8.	 Transfer the crepe to a plate and repeat the process 
until the entire batter is used up.
9.	 Roll up the crepe and drizzle the peanut butter  
on top of them. Done! 
N O T E S :
•	100 g of greek yogurt is also great on top of  
crepe or as a filling.
