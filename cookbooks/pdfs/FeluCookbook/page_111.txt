CREAMY CHICKEN
& RICE
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Add water and the rice to a pot (18cm or 7inch diameter) 
with a pinch of salt. Place it on a stove on high heat. 
2.	 As soon the water starts to boil, reduce the heat to low, 
close the lid and let it simmer for 12-15 minutes.
3.	 Cut the chicken into strips. Dice the onion, and peel and 
grate the garlic cloves. Add gochujang with 100 g water 
and cornstarch into a small glass and mix until combined.
4.	 Preheat a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on medium-high and add 
oil to it. Start with frying the chicken on one side for  
1 minute. Add in onions, salt, and pepper, and flip the  
chicken. Make sure that the onions touch the pan surface. 
5.	 Keep frying for another 1-2 minutes.
6.	 Add water with Gochujang and keep cooking for  
another minute. 
7.	 Turn the heat down to medium-low, add in the cheese 
wedge and incorporate that into the sauce with a spatula, 
pressing it down until the sauce turns creamy and smooth.
8.	 Add rice to a bowl. Top with creamy chicken. Done!
N O T E S :
•	To add volume, I would recommend adding carrots and 
red bell pepper. Fry it before adding the chicken for  
2-3 minutes or remove the chicken and fry the  
vegetables after and add the chicken back once the  
veggies are soft.
