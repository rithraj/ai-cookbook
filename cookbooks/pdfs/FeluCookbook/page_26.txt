D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by chopping up the red pepper and onion into  
bite-size pieces. Then peel and grate the garlic.
2.	 Add oil to a pan and heat on a medium heat.
3.	 Add the pepper and onion to the pan and let them fry 
gently for around 6-7 minutes until they start to  
caramelize.
4.	 Add garlic and fry for 30 seconds and then add all the spi-
ces and mix until combined.
5.	 Next comes the crushed tomatoes with a splash of water 
and stir everything.
6.	 Close the lid and let everything simmer for around  
10 minutes.
7.	 Remove the lid and let the tomato sauce reduce  
for another 5 minutes.
8.	 Dig 3 holes with a spoon and crack 3 eggs into the holes. 
Close the lid and cook the eggs for 2-3 minutes,  
so the yolk is still runny. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 Add diced black olives and parsley as garnish.
•	 Toast two slices of french baguette in a pan and lay them in a 
plate as the base to this dish before adding shakshuka on top.
•	 You can reduce the calories by simply adding less oil,  
but you will get less caramelization and less flavor. 
•	 You can swap out some of the whole eggs for egg whites  
only to reduce calories further. I’d recommend 50 g egg  
whites for each whole egg removed.
