 Ginger is great when pickled,  
 and the combination of sweet  
 and sour is epic!

PICKLED
GINGER
I N G R E D I E N T S :
300 g 	 	
ginger (young)
300 g 	 	
white vinegar
300 g 	 	
water
Pinch 	 	
salt
optional:	
20 g 	
	
sugar
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Peel the skin from the ginger and slice it into very 
fine slices. Young ginger has brighter and thinner 
skin, and the ginger itself is also brighter.  
It will taste lighter and will work best with vinegar. 
But that’s not to say that older ginger won’t work 
just as well.
2.	 Add ginger to a jar.
3.	 Add water, vinegar, salt and optional sugar into 
a pot on high heat. Wait until everything starts 
boiling. 
4.	 Switch off the heat and pour the liquid into  
the jar with the ginger.
5.	 Close the jar and place it into the fridge. Done!
N O T E S :
•	It can be added on top of chicken recipes,  
salads, and inside burritos.
•	Try to add aromatics like herbs, Jalapenos or  
spices like cumin or peppercorns before  
refrigerating to add more flavor.
•	The sugar is recommended even though it will add 
80 calories - per serving it won’t be that much.
