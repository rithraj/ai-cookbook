TERIYAKI
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
1 	
	
chicken breast or 180 g
1 	
	
medium onion or 50 g
100 g 	 	
kohlrabi
25 g 	
	
soy sauce
10 g

D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Optional Step: Prepare the chicken as described in the 
chapter “washing and marinating meat to tenderize”.
2.	 If you don’t marinate, cut the chicken into bite-sized 
cubes and add salt on top of the chicken.
3.	 Chop up onion and Kohlrabi into roughly  
the same size.
4.	 Place a small glass on a scale. Add soy, honey,  
rice vinegar and cornstarch and mix until combined.
5.	 Add 2 g of oil to a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on medium heat. 
Start with frying onion and Kohlrabi for 5 minutes  
under occasional stirring.
6.	 Push the veggies to the edges of the pan, and switch  
the heat to medium high, before adding 2 g oil and  
the chicken breast. Fry the chicken for 2-3 minutes.
7.	 Add sauce and keep cooking until it’s sticky,  
	
around 30 seconds. Done!
N O T E S :
•	You can swap out Kohlrabi for cabbage or carrots.
•	Make it with 50 g of rice.  
This will add 175 more calories and will taste great.
