D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Place the chicken thighs in a bowl and add salt, pepper, garlic 	 	
	
powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, and chili powder. 	
	
	
Mix until the thighs are coated with the seasoning.
2.	 Dice the onion, carrots, and red bell peppers into bite-size 	
	
	
pieces.
3.	 Add 5g of oil to a pan over medium-high heat and add the 	
	
	
chicken thighs. Fry them for 2 minutes on each side, just to get 		
	
some color, and then remove them from the pan.
4.	 Add 10g of oil to the pan and then add the vegetables. Fry them 	
	
for 7-10 minutes over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until 	 	
	
they are soft.
5.	 Add the rice, tomato salsa, and 300g of chicken stock (save some 	
	
stock for later).
6.	 Mix everything together, then add the chicken back to the pan. 	
	
Close the lid and let it simmer for 30 minutes over medium-low 	
	
heat.
7.	 Check on the rice every 10 minutes. If the bottom of the pan is 		
	
too dry, add more stock and continue simmering.
8.	 After 30 minutes, check the rice and adjust the salt if needed. 
9.	 Remove the chicken from the pan, cut it into smaller bite-size 	 	
	
pieces, and add them back to the pan.
10.	Prepare 3 meal prep containers and divide the pan contents 	
	
	
equally among them. Done!
