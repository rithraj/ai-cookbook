D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Add the chicken thighs to a baking sheet. 
2.	 Add oil on top of the chicken. 
3.	 Mix salt, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika and black 
pepper in a small container. And sprinkle seasoning on 
top of all the chicken thighs and rub them with your 
hands until well coated.
4.	 Bake the chicken in the oven for 20 minutes  
at 200°C or 400°F.
5.	 Add the rice with curry powder, cayenne pepper and a 
pinch of salt in a pot (18cm or 7inch diameter).  
Pour in water and close the lid.
6.	 Pop it on the stove on high heat until it starts boiling. 
7.	 Turn down the heat and let it simmer  
for 12-15 minutes.
8.	 Add avocado and cream cheese to a bowl.  
Add Jalapeno hot sauce. Add a pinch of salt and black 
pepper, and now smash everything together  
with a fork until smooth.
9.	 Once everything is ready, add chicken  
with rice on a plate and top it with the avocado dip. 
N O T E S :
•	Don’t worry about overbaking the chicken thighs,  
as they tend to take a lot longer to turn dry than  
a chicken breast would.
