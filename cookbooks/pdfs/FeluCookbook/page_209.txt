D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 If you only have access to a whole cauliflower, 
then start by cutting off the florets until you have 
around 100 g. Then you can grate them into rice.
2.	 Add the cauliflower rice to a pot with 250 g of  
salted water. 
3.	 Cook on medium heat for 10 minutes.
4.	 Add the oats and another 50 g of water and let it 
slowly simmer until it becomes thick and creamy 
in consistency. This should take around 5 minutes.
5.	 Add powdered peanuts and whey and cook while 
stirring for a further 30 seconds. Add a splash 
more water if it doesn’t mix well.
6.	 Transfer to a bowl and eat right away or  
refrigerate overnight for overnight oats.
