D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop up all vegetables into small pieces.  
Cut the american cheese into small pieces as well.
2.	 Add avocado, cheese, lime juice, salt, pepper and garlic 
powder into a bowl. Mash it with a fork until smooth.
3.	 Spread the avocado mix on the tortilla as a layer.
4.	 Add oil into a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on medium-high heat 
and fry the onion and pak choi for 3-4 minutes.
5.	 Add salt and pepper and mix. 
6.	 Now add the egg whites and immediately follow with the 
cheese. Spread everything out nicely with a spatula for  
30 seconds.
7.	 Transfer the egg on top of the tortilla and avocado and 
spread the eggs with a spatula. Put the tortilla back into 
the pan.
8.	 Flip one side of the tortilla on top of the other to form a 
quesadilla, and press it down gently with your spatula.  
Salt the outside of the tortilla and fry both sides for about 
30 seconds or until you have a nice color. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 You can add 25g shredded Mozzarella if you don’t like 	
	
	 american cheese.
•	 You can add another sauce to save calories.  
My mint sauce (see chapter) works best.
