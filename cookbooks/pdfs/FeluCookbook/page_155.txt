I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
2 	
	
wheat tortilla (20cm or 8inch)
180 g 	 	
ground beef 95/5
½	
	
red bell pepper or 75 g
1 	
	
medium onion or 50 g
100 g 	 	
tomatoes
1 	
	
clove of garlic
30 g 	
	
shredded mozzarella
50 g 	
	
water
25 g 	
	
soy sauce
15 g 	
	
gochujang
150 g 	 	
pumpkin puree
2 g 	
	
oil
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Dice the onion. Chop up tomatoes and bell pepper  
into small pieces. Peel and grate garlic.
2.	 Place a bowl on a scale. Add in pumpkin puree, gochujang,  
soy sauce and water. Mix until smooth.
3.	 Heat up a pan (24cm/9,5inch) to medium heat and 
add in 2g of oil. Start with adding onions and bell pepper.  
Fry them for 3 minutes until they start caramelizing.
4.	 Add ground beef, switch up the heat to medium-high and  
keep frying the beef for 1-2 minutes. Separate the beef,  
so as much beef as possible gets in contact with the pan.
5.	 After the beef has some brown spots, add in the garlic  
and the tomatoes. Keep frying for another minute,  
pressing down the tomatoes, so they release their juices.
6.	 Add in the sauce and combine everything, around 1 minute longer.
7.	 Switch off the heat and add in mozzarella cheese.  
Combine everything so the cheese can melt.
8.	 Place 2 tortillas on a table. Distribute the meat equally on both 
tortillas. Clean the pan and place it back on the stove on  
medium-high heat.
9.	 Add 1 tortilla in and flip one side over the other to build  
a quesadilla. Repeat with the other tortilla, so both  
quesadillas are side by side in the pan.  
Add a small pinch salt on top of the quesadilla.
10.	Flip after 30-60 seconds until both sides have a brown color. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 Use a big pan for this one, especially if you use 2 tortillas that  
will be cooked simultaneously at the end. Otherwise make 1 after 
the other.
