D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Add rice with water in a pot (18cm or 7inch diameter) 
with a pinch of salt. Place it on a stove on high heat.  
As soon the water starts to boil, reduce the heat to low, 
close the lid and let it simmer for 12-15 minutes.
2.	 Dice onion and tomato into small pieces.  
Peel and grate garlic clove.
3.	 Add soy, rice vinegar, honey and powdered peanuts into 
a glass. Add black pepper and mix until combined.
4.	 Add oil to a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on medium heat and 
add onions. Fry them for 3 minutes until they start  
caramelizing.
5.	 Switch the heat up to medium-high and add in the beef. 
Fry beef for 1-2 minutes until it starts becoming brown.
6.	 Now add tomatoes and mix everything. Push down the 
tomatoes, so they release their juice. About 2 minutes.
7.	 Now add sauce and stir everything and let it simmer for 
about 30 seconds. Remove from the heat if this is earlier 
ready than rice, and close the lid.
8.	 As soon rice is ready, add it to the pan with  
the meat and mix everything. Done!
N O T E S :
•	Add 10 g Gochujang to soy sauce to add some heat.
•	Add 1 laughing cow wedge at the end to  
make it super creamy. It will add 40 calories.
