 Curry is super underrated in my  
 opinion. And it is perfect with chicken  
 and rice and will add a ton of flavor  
 without too many calories.

CURRY
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Add water to the rice in a pot (18cm or 7inch diameter) 
with a pinch of salt. Place it on a stove on high heat. 
2.	 As soon the water starts to boil, reduce the heat to low, 
close the lid and let it simmer for 12-15 minutes.
3.	 Cut the chicken into strips. And mix 100 g of water  
with 1 tsp chicken stock in a glass.
4.	 Add oil into a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on medium-high heat 
and add in the curry paste. Fry it for 30 seconds. 
5.	 Add chicken stock and coconut milk to a pot  
and let it simmer for 1 minute.
6.	 Turn the heat to high, add the frozen vegetables,  
close the lid and wait until it starts to simmer again.  
This will take 2 minutes because of the frozen vegetables.
7.	 Turn down the heat to medium-low and add in the 
chicken. Let it simmer for around 4-5 minutes until the 
chicken is done. 
8.	 Squeeze lime juice into the curry.  
Put rice into a bowl and add the curry on top. Done!
N O T E S :
•	Instead  frozen vegetables,  
you can also use fresh ones of course. 
•	Also, there is a difference between coconut creme  
and coconut milk. If you use coconut creme,  
then only use 25g and fill the rest with 75g water.
