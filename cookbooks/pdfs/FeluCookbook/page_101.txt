D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by cutting the baguette in half and scooping 	
	
out the soft part of the bread to save about half 	 	
	
the calories.
2.	 Slice the chicken into small, bite-sized pieces.
3.	 In a small bowl, combine the soy sauce, rice 	
	
	
vinegar, honey, and cornstarch; mix well.
4.	 In another small bowl, combine the light mayo, 	
	
	
hoisin, and sriracha; mix well.
5.	 Heat oil in a pan over medium heat, and fry the 	 	
	
chicken for 1 minute on each side. Season with 	
	
	
black pepper and garlic powder.
6.	 Add the sauce (the soy sauce mixture) to the pan 		
	
and stir for about 20 seconds, until it thickens. 	
	
	
Then remove from heat.
7.	 Place one half of the baguette on a plate and 	
	
	
spread the mayo-hoisin-sriracha sauce on the 	
	
	
bottom. Top with the chicken, pickles, and a 	
	
	
handful of chopped cilantro. Done!
N O T E S :
•	The soft part of the bread can be baked in the oven 	
	 to make croutons, or you can place it in a zip-lock 		
	 bag and use it to feed the birds outside your house.
