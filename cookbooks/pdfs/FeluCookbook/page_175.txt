D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by placing a bowl on a scale.
2.	 Add all Ingredients.
3.	 Whisk for around 30 to 60 seconds. The texture will 
slowly become increasingly smooth. Keep whisking.
4.	 Place parchment paper onto a baking tray (10x10 cm).
5.	 Now transfer everything onto the baking sheet.
6.	 Bake at 180°C or 350°F for around 30-45 min.  
Check after 30 min if the cake is ready.
7.	 Once the cake is ready, remove from the oven and 
allow to cool for 15 min before cutting it into 2 equal 
size servings.
8.	 Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or if you can,  
overnight. The cake tends to last in the fridge for 
around 3-4 days.
N O T E S :

You can add more servings by simply adding the 
same amount of ingredients for every 2 additional 
servings. If you make 8 servings for example, the 
amount would be 800g of cream cheese, 800 g of 
Skyr, 4 whole eggs and 120 g of whey powder.  
The process remains the same.
