HASH BROWNS
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
500 g 	 	
mealy potatoes
1 	
	
medium onion or 50 g
4 g 	
	
oil
Salt and black pepper
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Peel the potatoes. 
2.	 Then grate them with a box grater. Add them to a bowl 
filled with water, so they don’t turn brown. Repeat with 
all the potatoes.
3.	 Now rinse the water and add the potatoes to a big tea towel.
4.	 Close the tea towel and squeeze the water out of it as 
much as you can. Do this over the big bowl.
5.	 Remove the water from the bowl and add the squeezed 
potatoes in. Add a strong pinch of salt and black pepper.  
Mix everything well.
6.	 Now preheat a waffle iron, and add some oil on both 
sides.
7.	 Chop up an onion into very small pieces.
8.	 Add 10 g of onion to the waffle iron, add 100 g of  
potatoes on top and close the waffle iron and press it 
down so you hear a sizzle. 
9.	 Let it cook for 2 minutes, then press again until it closes 
completely and let it cook for another 6-8 minutes until 
cooked through. 
10.	Remove the hash brown and repeat with the entire  
batch of potatoes and onion. Done!
