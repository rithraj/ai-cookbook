D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Add rice with water in a pot (18cm or 7inch diameter) 
with a pinch of salt. Place it on a stove on high heat.  
As soon the water starts to boil, reduce the heat to low, 
close the lid and let it simmer for 12-15 minutes.
2.	 Dice the onion, carrot, and bell pepper into small pieces. 
3.	 Put the chicken breast in a ziplock bag and flatten it 	
	
	
evenly using a heavy pot, focusing on the 	
	
	
	
thicker side of the chicken breast. Then, season the 	
	
	
chicken on both sides with salt, garlic powder, and 	
	
	
smoked paprika.
4.	 Add some oil to a pan over medium heat and add the 	 	
	
vegetables with a small pinch of salt. Fry them for 5-7 	 	
	
minutes until caramelized.
5.	 Remove the vegetables from the pan, add another 	
	
	
drizzle of oil, and then add the chicken. Fry the chicken 	
	
for 5-6 minutes, flipping it every minute until it is 	
	
	
cooked through.
6.	 Meanwhile, add cottage cheese, gochujang, honey, 1g of 	
	
garlic powder, black pepper, and all of the fried 	
	
	
vegetables to a blender. Blend on high for 1 minute until 	
	
you have a smooth orange sauce.
7.	 Place the rice in a bowl, followed by the chicken, and 	 	
	
then pour the sauce on top. Done!
