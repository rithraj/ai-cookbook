D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	
Start with the washing and marinating first if you  
choose to do it (see the How to Tenderize Lean Beef chapter).  
Otherwise, just cut the meat into strips.
2.	 Clean the potatoes with cold water, I don‘t peel them.  
Cut the potatoes into fries. Add them to a baking dish, add oil, 
and a pinch of salt and mix everything with your hands.
3.	
Bake the potatoes for 30 min at 200°C or 400°F.  
Flip them halfway through with a spatula. You can also use an 
air fryer for the potatoes.
4.	 Chop up all vegetables into equal bite-size pieces.  
Peel and grate the garlic.
5.	
Add the beef to a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on medium-high heat.  
If you don’t marinate the beef, you need to add a bit of oil to the pan.
6.	 Fry the meat for 60 seconds on both sides until they get color. 
7.	
Remove the beef, and add all vegetables except the tomatoes 
into the pan. You might need to add another touch oil. Fry this 
under occasional stirring for 7-10 minutes on medium heat.
8.	 Add in garlic for 15 seconds, and then add in the tomatoes.  
Add in black pepper, close the lid and let the tomatoes simmer 
for another 3 minutes.
9.	
Add in the sauce and the beef and let everything cook for 1 more 
minute. If you haven’t marinated the meat, then you might need 
to add a bit of starch slurry (mix 50g  cold water with 2 g  corn-
starch in a bowl and start adding half in the pan).
10.	 Potatoes should be ready, so put them on a plate and cover 
everything with your beef, veggies, and sauce.  
Top with cilantro or parsley. Done! 
N O T E S :
•	 Beef can be swapped out for chicken breast or lean pork.
•	 Potatoes can be swapped out for rice.
