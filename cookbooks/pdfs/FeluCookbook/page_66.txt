D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Place a bowl on a scale and add flour, garlic 	
	
	
powder, onion powder, and salt. Mix them 		
	
	
together.
2.	 Then, add skyr and egg whites to the bowl and mix 	
	
until smooth.
3.	 Add oil to a pan (25cm/10 inches) on medium heat 	
	
and pour in the batter. Immediately start tilting 	
	
	
and shaking the pan until you achieve a round 	
	
	
pizza shape.
4.	 Close the lid and let it cook for 3 minutes. Then, 	 	
	
flip the pizza dough every minute until both 	
	
	
sides have a nice brown color, for a total of 5 	
	
	
minutes.
5.	 Next, spread the tomato sauce on top, followed by 	
	
the deli meat, and finally the cheese.
6.	 Put the pizza under the broiler for 1 minute until 	 	
	
the cheese is fully melted. Done!
