D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Make the avocado cream cheese dip.
2.	 Add the oil to a pan on medium heat.
3.	 Chop up the onion and the deli meat into small pieces.  
Start frying them in the pan for around 3 minutes.
4.	 Meanwhile, cut the american cheese into small pieces. 
Crack 1 egg on a plate and add the egg white, add a pinch 
of salt and black pepper and mix with a fork. Spread the 
cream cheese avocado dip on the tortilla.
5.	 As soon as the onions are caramelized and the deli meat is 
brown, add the eggs and the cheese and start mixing  
for 30 seconds.
6.	 Remove the eggs and add them to the avocado  
dip in the tortilla.
7.	 Roll up the tortilla into a burrito shape. I flip left and right 
into the middle first and then roll from the bottom upwards 
until it is closed.
8.	 Place the closed tortilla back into the dry pan and toast the 
side where the tortilla is closed. Then flip the tortilla to toast 
all 4 sides. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 You can also add 2 whole eggs instead of 1 whole egg and one 
egg white. It will have 50 more calories due to the 5g of fat.
