SALAD
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
200 g 	 	
cucumber
20 g 	
	
soy sauce
10 g 	
	
rice vinegar
10 g

5 g

Salt
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Wash and then cut the cucumber into very thin 	 	
	
slices. Place them in a strainer, sprinkle with a 	
	
	
pinch of salt, and mix well. Let the cucumber sit 	 	
	
for 2–3 hours or overnight until most of the 	
	
	
water has drained out, then pat the slices dry. (You 	
	
can skip this step and add the cucumber directly, 		
	
but the salad will be a bit more watery.)
2.	 Peel and grate the garlic and ginger, then add 	
	
	
them to a bowl. Add all the remaining ingredients, 	
	
followed by the cucumber, and give everything a 		
	
good stir. Done!
N O T E S :
•	Feel free to switch vegetables. Red bell pepper, car-
rots, and onions work great in this salad.
