I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
180 g 	 	
ground beef 95/5
250 g 	 	
potatoes
1 	
	
medium onion or 50g
50 g 	
	
lettuce
50 g 	
	
pickles
50 g 	
	
tomatoes
5 g 	
	
oil
1 g 	
	
dry rosemary
1 serving	
1000 island sauce (see recipe)
1 serving	
3 ingredient cheese sauce (see 	
	
	
recipe)
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Peel and Cut the potatoes into thick slices, then into fries and 
then again into bite-size cubes. 2x2cm or 1x1 inch.
2.	 Microwave the potatoes in a bowl for 5 min at 600W.
3.	 Prepare one serving each of 1000 Island sauce and 	 	
	
	
cheese sauce.
4.	 Finely chop onions, pickles, lettuce, and tomatoes.
5.	 In a pan, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add the 	
	
	
	
microwaved potatoes and a pinch of salt. Fry them 	 	
	
	
for about 5 minutes or until they are golden brown. Then 	
	
	
remove the potatoes from the pan.
6.	 Add a bit more oil to the pan, and sauté the onions for 	
	
	
2-3 minutes, or until they are translucent and slightly 	
	
	
golden.
7.	 Push the onions to the side of the pan, add another bit 	
	
	
of oil, and place the beef in the pan. Break up the meat, 	
	
	
ensuring as much of the meat as possible is in contact 	
	
	
with the pan. Season with salt and black pepper.
8.	 After one minute, combine the beef with the onions in 	
	
	
the pan and continue frying for another minute.
9.	 Turn off the heat, then pour in the cheese sauce, mixing 	
	
	
continuously for about 30 seconds until the mixture is 	
	
	
creamy.
10.	To serve, arrange the fried potatoes on a plate, top with 	
	
	
the chopped vegetables, followed by the 1000 Island 	
	
	
sauce, and finally, add the creamy cheesy beef mixture 	
	
	
on top. Done!
