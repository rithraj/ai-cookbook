D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Dice the onion. Add the water and broth powder to  
a glass and mix until combined. 
2.	 Add oil to a pan on medium heat and add the  
onion. Fry them for around 3 minutes or until translucent.
3.	 Add the rice and fry for a further 2 minutes.
4.	 Add garlic and tomato puree and keep frying for  
about 20 seconds.
5.	 Add the crushed tomatoes, broth, and black pepper  
and mix everything well. 
6.	 Close the lid and let it simmer for 12-15 minutes or  
until the rice is almost done.
7.	 Turn the heat to medium-high and add in the frozen 
prawns. Keep cooking for 2-3 minutes until the  
prawns are cooked, and the rice is done.
8.	 Add the peas at the very end and give everything  
a stir and keep cooking for another 30 seconds.
9.	 Turn the heat off, and add a bunch of parsley on top.  
Done!
N O T E S :
•	I use Arborio rice for this recipe. If you use long-grain rice 
like Jasmine or Basmati, the cooking time will be reduced 
by a couple  minutes.
•	You can also thaw the prawns overnight, so they cook 
faster, but it’s not necessary. I tend to always add them 
frozen.
