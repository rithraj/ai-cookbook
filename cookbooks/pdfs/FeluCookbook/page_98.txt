GYRO
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Preheat the oven to 200°C or 400°F
2.	 Add oil on both sides of the chicken thigh.  
Add salt, pepper, garlic powder, and oregano  
and cover the entire thigh.
3.	 Add chicken to a baking sheet and bake in the  
oven for 20 minutes. Alternatively use air fryer.
4.	 In the meantime, make 1 serving of two-ingredient 
dough naan bread (see chapter) or prepare a  
store-bought pita.
5.	 Peel and grate the garlic. Combine Greek yogurt,  
olive oil, lemon juice, salt, chopped dill,  
and grated garlicin a glass and mix until smooth.
6.	 Dice the tomatoes and onion.
7.	 If you have a store-bought pita, then heat it up in a pan.
8.	 Lay the pita/naan on a plate. Spread yogurt sauce in the 
middle. Add tomatoes and onions on top. 
9.	 Remove the chicken thigh from the oven and cut it into 
small chunks. Lay them on top of the tomatoes and  
onions. Close the gyro, and you’re done!
N O T E S :
•	If you buy a pita, try to shoot for 200 calories max.
•	Chicken thighs can be swapped out for pork or  
chicken breast, but then I would fry them in a pan  
instead of baking them.
