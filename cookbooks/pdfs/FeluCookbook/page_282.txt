CHAPTER 10
 SHIRATAKI 
 NOODLES 
Shirataki can smell quite strange so it’s important to  
buy the right type to avoid that strong fishy aroma. 
 
I have personally found that if the ingredient label doesn’t contain  
the ingredient “Calcium hydroxide” also known as pickling water,  
it’s a good choice. So even though this is no guarantee,  
it’s worth a try!
