Salt and black pepper
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Clean and slice the eggplant into even slices. Lay them on a 
wire rack and sprinkle salt on both sides. Let them sit for at least 
30 minutes or up to 6 hours to remove any bitterness.
2.	 Cut the tempeh into bite-size cubes. Peel and grate the garlic 	
	
and ginger, and chop up the onion.
3.	 Mix the stock powder with 50g of water in a glass until well 	
	
	
combined. Do the same with the coconut cream and water in 		
	
another glass.
4.	 Cut the marinated eggplant into cubes.
5.	 Heat up a pan over medium heat, add some oil, and fry the 	
	
	
tempeh cubes for 1-2 minutes until they turn golden brown. 	 	
	
Then remove them from the pan.
6.	 Add the cubed eggplant with a splash of water to the same 	
	
	
pan and fry for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally until they start 	
	
to collapse.
7.	 Add some more oil to the pan and add in the chopped onion, 		
	
frying everything for 3-4 minutes.
8.	 Now add in the grated ginger and garlic, tomato puree, 	
	
	
turmeric, paprika, chili powder, cumin, and black pepper. Mix 	 	
	
everything together so that the spices get toasted for 30 	
	
	
seconds.
9.	 Add the broth and the coconut milk. As soon as everything 	
	
	
starts to boil, reduce the heat to medium-low, add the tempeh 	
	
back to the pan and let it simmer for 8-10 minutes. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 Taste great with rice. 50g raw rice will add another 175 calories.
•	 Can also be made with plain tofu. The process remains the same.
•	 Top the dish with fresh cilantro.
