 Spaghetti squash is great to try high  
 calorie sauces because squash itself is  
 so low in calories and high in volume! 
ESTIMATED TIME: 60 MIN
FILLED SPAGHETTI
SQUASH
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  2  S E R V I N G S :
600 g 	 	
spaghetti squash  
	
	
(1 entire squash)
150 g 	 	
Italian sausage (the fatty one)
400 g 	 	
crushed tomatoes
1 	
	
medium onion or 50 g
2 	
	
cloves of garlic
2 g 	
	
oil
5 g 	
	
fresh basil
Salt and black pepper
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by preheating the oven to 200°C or 400°F.
2.	 Cut the squash into halves. Use a sharp knife and do it 
slowly. The shell might be hard to cut at first.
3.	 Remove the seeds with a spoon. Add salt and pepper  
on top of both squash halves. Put the squash with the 
open side looking down on a baking sheet and put it 
 in the oven for 45-60 minutes.
4.	 In the meantime, chop up onions,  
and peel and grate garlic.
5.	 Slice the sausage into halves lengthwise and remove  
the skin. Chop up the sausage into bite-size pieces.
6.	 Heat up a pan (24cm/9,5inch) to medium heat with oil. 
Add in onions and the sausage and let it fry for 4-5 
minutes. The fat of the sausage will render out and will 
caramelize the onions.
7.	 Add the garlic and keep frying for 20 seconds. Add a 
pinch of salt and black pepper. Add crushedd tomatoes, 
add a splash of water, stir everything, close the lid and 
let it simmer for 10 minutes.
8.	 After 10 minutes, add in the bunch of basil,  
stir the sauce, and it’s ready.
9.	 Pull out the squash from the oven. Mix the inside of the 
squash with a fork to get stringy flesh that looks like fine 
spaghetti. Remove all of the squash and plate onto two 
plates.
10.	Add sausage sauce on top of both plates. Done!

N O T E S :
•	 The low-calorie amount of squash allows you to  
make a high-calorie sausage sauce and still have  
a low-calorie high-volume meal.
•	 You can swap out the sausage for 250 g skinless,  
boneless chicken thighs for more protein and fewer  
calories. The steps above remain the same.
•	 You can add 15 g of grated parmesan on top  
 each serving. It will add 60 more calories.
