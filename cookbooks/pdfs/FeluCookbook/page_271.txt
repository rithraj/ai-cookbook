D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Place a blender on a scale.
2.	 Add all ingredients,  
starting with greek yogurt.
3.	 Blend for 30 seconds until smooth.  
You might need to take off the blender  
and shake it, so nothing keeps sticking  
at the top. That is why starting with adding  
Greek yogurt works best.
4.	 Transfer the sauce to a squeeze bottle. Done!
N O T E S :
•	The sauce can be stored in the fridge  
for up to a week.
