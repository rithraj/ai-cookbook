D I R E C T I O N S :

gano, a pinch of salt, and black pepper.
3.	 Sprinkle the seasoning mixture over the chicken and use your 
hands to mix until all the pieces are coated. Set aside.
4.	 Chop up the peppers and the onion into bite-size pieces. Peel 
and grate the garlic.
5.	 Prepare either the avocado dip or the taco sauce.
6.	 Add oil to a pan on medium heat. Start with adding the peppers 
and the onion, add a pinch of salt and fry them for 5 minutes.
7.	 After the vegetables are brown, push the to the side of the pan, 
another bit of oil and add in the chicken.
8.	 Fry the chicken for 1 minute on one side and then mix everyt-
hing so the seasoning spreads evenly.
9.	 Keep frying for another minute until the chicken is cooked 
through and then add in the grated garlic. Fry the garlic for anot-
her 20 seconds and then remove the pan from the heat.
10.	Squeeze in the juice from half a lime and add a bunch of chop-
ped cilantro. Mix everything.
11.	 Heat up 2 tortillas, you can also do this step while frying the 
chicken. Plate everything. Done!

and for the chicken and do the same steps.
