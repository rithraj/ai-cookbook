CHEESEBURGER 
BURRITO
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop the onion, lettuce, and tomatoes, and combine 	 	
	
them in a small bowl with light mayonnaise and sriracha.
2.	 Add oil to a 24 cm (9.5 inch) pan over medium-high 
heat. Add the chopped onion along with a pinch of salt 
and fry for 3 minutes.
3.	 Push the onions to one side of the pan, add a bit more 		
	
oil, and then add the ground beef. Cover it with 	
	
	
parchment paper and press it flat using a spatula and 	 	
	
something heavy, like a bottle.
4.	 Season the meat with salt, black pepper, and garlic 	
	
	
powder, then flip after 1 minute. Cook for another 	
	
	
minute, then break up the meat and mix everything 	
	
	
together.
5.	 Tear the cheese into small pieces, add them to the pan, 	
	
and wait until they melt.
6.	 Place a tortilla on a sheet of parchment paper. Add the 	
	
lettuce, tomatoes, and sauce, then top with the cheesy 		
	
beef and roll it into a burrito.
7.	 Return the burrito to the pan with a tiny bit of oil and 	 	
	
toast on all sides until golden brown. Sprinkle a little salt 	
	
on the outside for extra flavor.
8.	 Eat immediately, or wrap it tightly in parchment paper 		
	
and store in the fridge or freezer.
N O T E S :
•	This recipe can also be prepared for meal prep. Simply 	 	
	 multiply the ingredients by 2 or more. Allow the beef to 		
	 cool down completely before rolling it into the tortilla, as 	
	 steam can make the burrito soggy in the fridge.
