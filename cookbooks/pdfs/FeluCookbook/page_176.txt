D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by placing a bowl on a scale. Preheat the oven to 	
	
180°C (350°F).
2.	 Add the Greek yogurt, cream cheese, sweetener, 	
	
eggs, and protein powder. Whisk until smooth and 	
	
creamy.
3.	 Line a 22 × 18 cm (9 × 7 inch) baking dish with 	 	
	
parchment paper. Transfer the mixture into the 	
	
baking dish and bake for 35–45 minutes.
4.	 In a small pan (18 cm / 7 inch), add the milk, 	
	
	
cornstarch, and dark chocolate (broken into pieces).
5.	 Place the pan over medium-low heat and gently melt 
the chocolate, stirring until the mixture becomes thick 
and creamy.
6.	 Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool 	
	
for about 20 minutes.
7.	 Spread the chocolate sauce on top, then add the 	
	
pistachio butter. Chop the pistachios and sprinkle 	
	
them over everything.
8.	 Refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours—or 	
	
overnight for best results.
N O T E S :
•	
You can use peanut butter or even blueberries		
	
instead of pistachio butter.
