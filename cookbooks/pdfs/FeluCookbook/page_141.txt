I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
½ 	
	
butternut squash or 350 g
100 g

D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Peel the skin from the squash and remove  
the seeds with a spoon. 
2.	 Then slice it into bite-size cubes by first cutting it  
lengthways, turn it and slice again into cubes.
3.	 Chop up tomatoes and onions.
4.	 Cook pasta. Check out the ‘How to make  
proper pasta’ chapter.
5.	 Heat up a pan (24cm/9,5inch) to medium,  
add in oil and then add in the squash.  
Add a pinch of salt and black pepper and fry it for 
around 5 minutes with occasional stirring.
6.	 After 5 min, add in the onion and keep frying for  
another 3 minutes.
7.	 Add in tomatoes with water, close the lid  
and let it simmer for 3 minutes.
8.	 As soon as the pasta is ready, transfer it to the pan of 
squash with some pasta water, heat up the pan to high 
and let it cook for 1 minute without the lid. Done!
N O T E S :
•	Add a bunch of fresh basil at the very end  
for some fresh flavor.
•	Add 15-20 g of parmesan at the end for  
a super creamy sauce. This will add 80 calories.
