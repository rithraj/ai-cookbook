D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Slice the mushrooms into bitesize pieces.
2.	 Cut the chicken breast into strips.
3.	 Peel and grate the garlic cloves.
4.	 Add the water, broth, and starch into a small glass and 
mix until combined.
5.	 Start by adding the mushrooms to a dry pan on  
medium heat and add 50 g of water. Let it simmer  
without a lid until the water has evaporated  
and the mushrooms have collapsed.
6.	 Now add oil and fry them under occasional stirring  
until brown, around 4-5 minutes.
7.	 Push mushrooms to the side of the pan, and add  
another touch of oil and fry the chicken for  
1-1:30 minutes on each side until they get color.
8.	 Add in grated garlic for 30 seconds. Add in the sauce 
and let it simmer for 2 minutes until it thickens.
9.	 Now add in the cheese wedge and press it down with  
a spatula and combine everything slowly for 1 minute  
until creamy. Done!
N O T E S :
•	Chicken is fantastic with some rice.
•	I add hot jalapeno sauce at the end to add a spicy kick.
