D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by peeling the potatoes. 
2.	 Cut the potatoes into thick slices, then into fries and 
then again into bite-size cubes. 2x2cm or 1x1 inch.
3.	 Microwave the potatoes in a bowl for 5 min at 600W.
4.	 In the meantime, dice the onion. In a glass or bowl, 	
	
	
combine soy sauce, harissa paste, honey, black pepper, 	
	
garlic powder, and water. Stir these ingredients until fully 	
	
mixed.
5.	 Set a pan on the stove over medium-high heat.
6.	 Pour oil into the pan, then add the microwaved 	
potatoes. Fry them for around 3-4 minutes, stirring 
occasionally, until they are lightly browned. 
7.	 Add a bit more oil, followed by the diced onions, and 
continue frying for another 2-3 minutes. Then, incor-
porate the chickpeas and keep frying for an additional 
minute.
8.	 Pour in the previously prepared sauce mixture over the 	
	
potatoes. Next, carefully crack three eggs into the pan, 	
	
ensuring they are evenly spaced. Cover the pan with a 		
	
lid and allow the eggs to cook for 3-4 minutes until they 	
	
reach your desired level of doneness.
9.	 Optionally, garnish with cilantro or parsley. Your dish is 		
	
now ready to serve. Enjoy!
N O T E S :
•	You can swap out some of the whole eggs for egg whites  
only to reduce calories further. I’d recommend 50 g egg  
whites for each whole egg removed.
