SPICY BEEF &
NACHOS
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
180 g 	 	
ground beef 95/5 
2 	
	
wheat tortillas (20cm or 8inch)
1 	
	
medium onion or 50 g
15 g 	
	
gochujang
100 g 	 	
tomatoes
25 g 	
	
soy sauce
2 g 	
	
oil
Black pepper
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Dice the onion. Chop up tomatoes into bite-size pieces. 
Add soy sauce and Gochujang into a small glass and 
combine with a spoon until smooth. Pre-heat oven to 
180°C or 350°F. Cut tortillas into nacho shapes and lay 
them on top of aluminium foil on a baking sheet.  
Don’t bake them just yet.
2.	 Heat up a pan (24cm/9,5inch) to medium heat,  
add oil and start with frying the onions for 2-3 minutes.
3.	 Switch the heat to medium-high and add in the beef. 
Keep frying for another 2 minutes. Try to separate the 
beef with a spatula, so as much beef as possible gets in 
contact with the pan.
4.	 Flip the beef and keep frying for another minute  
and then add in the tomatoes.
5.	 Keep frying the tomatoes for another minute. 
6.	 Add the sauce to the pan and combine everything. 
Switch off the heat, close the lid and just let it sit there 
until the nachos are done.
7.	 Add the nachos into the oven and bake them for 4-5 
minutes until they just start to become brown.
8.	 Remove the nachos and add them to a plate.  
Top them with the beef. Done!
N O T E S :
•	Be careful not to overbake the nachos.  
They can become dry because there is no fat in them.
