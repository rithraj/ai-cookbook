D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Dice onion and pepper into small pieces.  
Cut tomatoes into smaller pieces.
2.	 Add all spices into a glass and mix until combined.
3.	 Add oil into a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on medium heat 
and add onion and peppers. Fry them for  
3-4 minutes under occasional stirring.
4.	 Push vegetables to the side, switch up the heat  
to medium-high and add beef. Spread it with a  
spatula, so as much meat as possible comes in  
contact with the pan. Fry the beef for 1 minute.
5.	 Add spices and tomatoes and stir everything.  
Add a splash of water. Let everything cook for one 
more minute, and press down the tomatoes  
occasionally so they release their juices.
6.	 Add laughing cow wedges and spread them by  
pressing them down until they are fully incorporated.
7.	 Add instant rice with another splash of water and 
stir everything until the rice is hot and incorpora-
ted into the meat and vegetable mixture. Done!
N O T E S :
•	Carrots can be added to this recipe as well at the 
beginning with the onion and peppers.
•	You can also make 60 g of raw rice instead instant.
