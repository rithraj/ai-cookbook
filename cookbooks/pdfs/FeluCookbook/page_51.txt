D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	
Place a bowl on a scale. Preheat a pan  
(24cm or 8,5 inch) on medium heat.
2.	 Cut the Mozzarella and deli meat into small cubes. 
3.	 Add flour, egg, milk and salt to a bowl and whisk until 
smooth. Alternatively, add everything to a blender  
and mix for 15 seconds.
4.	 Add oil to the pan. 
5.	 Add 1/3  the batter and tilt the pan around  
until the batter forms a round shape.
6.	 Let the batter cook for 60-90 seconds or until the batter is set. 
7.	 Flip it every 60 seconds until you have a light  
golden brown color. 2-3 minutes in total.  
8.	 As soon as you’ve flipped, add 1/3 of the cheese and  
deli meat into the crepe and close one side over the other,  
so it looks like a Quesadilla.
9.	 Continue to cook and flip 1 more time until the  
cheese starts melting nicely. You’re done.
10.	 Repeat with the rest of the batter.  
It will make 3 filled crepes.
N O T E S :
•	 You can also add the cheese and deli meat directly into  
the batter and cook them together.
•	 Swap out the whole egg for 50 g egg whites to reduce calories.
