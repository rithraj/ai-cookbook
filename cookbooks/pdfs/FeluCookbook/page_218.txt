D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Place a bowl on your scale.
2.	 Chop up pineapple into small pieces.
3.	 Add all ingredients to the bowl.
4.	 Mix everything until smooth.
5.	 Refrigerate overnight. 
6.	 You’re done!
N O T E S :
•	You can use whey but if you do so,  
then use less water. 
•	Casein will give you a creamier oatmeal.
•	Don’t add lemon juice, as this can make  
it super sour.
•	It’s important to use canned pineapple.  
But if you want to use fresh, then add it in  
the morning, just before you eat it.
