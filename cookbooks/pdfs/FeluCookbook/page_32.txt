D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Add the egg and egg white to a bowl with seasonings 
and mix with a fork until everything is combined and 
smooth.
2.	 Add the bread and allow it to soak up the eggs  
for 20 seconds before you flip them.  
Flip them 3-4 times in total.
3.	 Add oil to a pan on medium heat and add in the bread 
slices. If you have leftover eggs from the soaking  
mixture, pour it on top of the bread now. 
4.	 Fry both sides slowly under occasional flipping for  
4-5 minutes in total until both sides have a warm golden 
brown color. Before you flip the first time, add another 
spray of oil to the pan, so both sides brown well.
5.	 Add the deli meat to the pan beside the bread until it’s 
nice and crisp. Then add mozzarella on top of 1 sandwich 
bread. Close the lid for 30 seconds. 
6.	 Add deli meat on top of the mozzarella. Put the other 
slice of bread on top and fip the entire sandwich one 
more time. Fry for a further 30 seconds. Done!
