D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Grind the oats in a blender for around  
60 seconds or until it becomes oat flour.
2.	 Now place a bowl on the scale.
3.	 Add all dry ingredients.  
Whisk everything for 10-15 seconds.
4.	 Place a second bowl on the scale.
5.	 Smash the banana in the second bowl with  
a fork until it becomes mush.  
Add the lemon juice to the banana and mix. 
6.	 Add all wet ingredients to the second bowl  
and mix well until combined.
7.	 Add the wet ingredients to the dry  
ingredients and slowly whisk until smooth.  
Add a small splash of water if it sticks.
8.	 Place parchment paper into a baking sheet (12x18cm 
or 5x7inch). Then you can transfer the batter onto the 
baking sheet and bake for 30-35 min at 180°C or 350°F.
9.	 After baking, remove the cake from the  
baking sheet and let it cool down for 30 min.
10.	Now you can slice and enjoy.  
The banana bread lasts in the fridge for 2-3 days.
N O T E S :
•	
You can add 1-2 tablespoons of cinnamon for extra flavor.
•	
Whey/Casein blend would work best in this recipe.
•	
Add a bit of water if the batter is dry.  
That is because of the casein.
