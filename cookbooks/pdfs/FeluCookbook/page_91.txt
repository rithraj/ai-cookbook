D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Slice the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Prepare the 
mint sauce and store it in a squeeze bottle; it will last in 
the fridge for up to one week.

heat. Add the chicken and fry it for 1 minute on each 
side. Season with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and 
cayenne pepper just before removing it from the pan.
3.	 Spread the figs on a tortilla, add 15g of sauce on top, and 	
	
then layer the cooked chicken.
4.	 Roll up the tortilla and place it back in the hot pan, 	
	
	
toasting all four sides until crispy and golden brown. 	
	
	
Done!
