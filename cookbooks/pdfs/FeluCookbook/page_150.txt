Salt and black pepper
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Add rice with water in a pot (18cm or 7inch dia	
	
	
meter) with a pinch of salt. Place it on a stove on 	 	
	
high heat. As soon the water starts to boil, reduce 	
	
the heat to low, close the lid and let it simmer for 		
	
12-15 minutes.
2.	 Preapre the pb & soy sauce.
3.	 Next, cut the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces 	
	
and season them with salt, black pepper, and garlic 	
	
powder. Similarly, dice the carrots, avocado, and 	 	
	
pineapple into bite-sized pieces.
4.	 Preheat a pan (24cm or 9.5 inch) over medium-	
	
	
high heat and add oil to it. Begin by frying the 	
	
	
chicken pieces on one side for about 1 minute. 	
	
	
Then flip the chicken over and cook for an 	
	
	
additional minute. Remove the chicken from 	
	
	
the pan and set aside. If you‘re using frozen peas, 	
	
fry them in the same pan for 1 minute.
5.	 To serve, add rice to a bowl. Top the rice with the 	 	
	
prepared fruit, vegetables, and chicken. Finish 	
	
	
off with a drizzle of the PB & soy sauce mixture.

	 things up. Mangos or peaches work great here.
