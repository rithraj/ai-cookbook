5.	 Now add all the dry ingredients to the wet 
ingredients and whisk again slowly until smooth.
6.	 Place parchment paper onto a baking sheet  
(8x22cm or 3x9 inch).
7.	 Transfer the smooth batter to baking sheet and  
bake for 40-45 min at 180°C or 350°F.

the fridge for 2-3 days.
N O T E S :
•	
You can make this with homemade pumpkin puree 
(see recipe) to make an even tastier version.
•	
Whey protein is recommended here because casein 
doesn’t rise properly when baked.
