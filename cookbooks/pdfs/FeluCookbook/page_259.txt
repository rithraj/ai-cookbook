D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop peppers, onions, and jalapenos into small 
pieces. Peel and grate garlic. Clean and cut potato-
es into bite-size cubes.
2.	 In a glass of water, combine stock powder and dry 	
	
gelatine. Mix until well combined and set aside.
3.	 Heat oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. 	
	
	
Add ground beef and cook in batches until 	
	
	
browned. Transfer the browned beef to a large pot 	
	
and repeat with the remaining beef.
4.	 After all the beef is cooked and removed, add 	
	
	
more oil to the pan and sauté the vegetables 	
	
	
for 5-7 minutes until they have some color.
5.	 Add minced garlic, chili powder, paprika, cumin, 	 	
	
a strong pinch of salt, and black pepper to the pan. 	
	
Toast the spices for 20 seconds, then pour in 	
	
	
the vegetable stock. Deglaze the pan for 30 	
	
	
seconds before transferring everything to the pot 	
	
with the ground beef.
6.	 Add crushed tomatoes, kidney beans, cocoa 	
	
	
powder, and the canned tomatoes (cleaned out 	
	
	
with water, if desired) to the pot. Close the lid 	
	
	
and let it simmer on medium-low heat for 30-40 	 	
	
minutes.
7.	 Remove the lid for the last 10 minutes of cooking 		
	
to reduce the liquid. Check for seasoning and 	
	
	
adjust as necessary.
8.	 Divide the chili evenly into 5 meal prep containers 	
	
and store in the fridge for up to 5 days. Enjoy!
