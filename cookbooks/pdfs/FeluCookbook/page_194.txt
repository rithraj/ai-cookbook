ESTIMATED TIME: 40 MIN
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by grinding the oats in a blender for  
60 seconds until it becomes oat flour.
2.	 Next, place a bowl on your scale.
3.	 Add all the dry ingredients to the bowl.  
Whisk everything for 10-15 secs.
4.	 Place another bowl on the scale to  
measure out the wet ingredients.
5.	 Add all wet ingredients into the second bowl  
	
and mix until combined.
6.	 Add the wet to the dry ingredients and  
slowly whisk until smooth.
7.	 Place parchment paper onto a pie dish  
(28cm or 11inch diameter). 
8.	 Transfer the batter to the pie dish. Cut the apple into 
equal size wedges and place them on top of the batter.
9.	 Bake for 30-35 min at 180°C or 350°F.
10.	After baking, let it cool for 15 min.  
The apple pie lasts in the fridge for 2-3 days.
N O T E S :
•	Whey/Casein blend will work just as well. Casein only isn’t 
the best option though due to the need for 350g yogurt.
•	You can peel apples if you don’t like the skin left on.
•	You can also use a square baking dish instead of the pie dish.
•	Add a bit of water if the batter is dry.  
That is because of the casein.
