CHEESESTEAK SUB 
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by cutting the baguette in half and scooping 	
	
out the soft part of the bread to save about half 	 	
	
the calories.
2.	 Next, slice the beef into very fine strips. For easier 
cutting, place the steak in the freezer for 30 minu-
tes beforehand.
3.	 Add to a bowl cheddar, cornstarch, and 	
	
	
	
evaporated 	milk and mix. Chop up the onion.
4.	 Heat oil in a pan over medium heat and begin 	
	
	
frying the onion for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. 	
	
Add a  pinch of salt.
5.	 Then, push the onion to the side of the pan, add a 	
	
bit more oil, and add the beef. Fry the beef for 	
	
	
45-60 seconds on each side. Season with salt, 	
	
	
black pepper, and garlic powder.
6.	 Turn off the heat and add the cheese. Continue 	 	
	
stirring until the cheese melts and the mixture 	
	
	
becomes gooey.
7.	 Finally, transfer the beef onto the baguette and 	 	
	
enjoy!
N O T E S :
•	The soft part of the bread can be baked in the oven 	
	 to make croutons, or you can place it in a zip-lock 		
	 bag and use it to feed the birds outside your house.
