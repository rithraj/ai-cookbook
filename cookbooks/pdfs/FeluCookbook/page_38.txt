D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by preheating a pan to medium heat.  
Not too high otherwise, the bread will burn.
2.	 Now add the bread slices to the pan to get them  
slightly toasted. 1 minute each side is enough.
3.	 Place a bowl on your kitchen scale to weigh the ingredients.
4.	 Add the egg, egg whites, milk, cinnamon and sweetener. 
Mix everything with a fork for about 20 seconds.
5.	 Remove bread from the pan and add them in the bowl.  
1 slice at a time and push it down. Let it soak up the eggs  
for 10-15 seconds. Flip the bread and push it down again.  
Place the bread on a separate plate. Repeat with the  
remaining 3 bread slices.
6.	 Add oil into the pan. Add as many bread slices as you  
can fit into the pan. You can also use 2 pans simultaneously 
if you make more slices of bread.
7.	 Let the french toast fry for 1-2 minutes and flip.  
Keep frying for another 1-2 minutes and flip again.  
Repeat until you have your desired consistency and  
browning. It takes about 6-7 minutes in total.
8.	 Remove the french toast and build a mighty tower.  
Top with skyr and 1 serving of powdered peanuts. Done! 
N O T E S :
•	 You can add blueberries to the pan and place the bread  
slices on top of them, so you fry them both together. 
•	 Topping can be switched to honey or sugar-free maple syrup. 
Please add both on a scale. Calories add up quickly.
