D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by peeling and cutting potatoes into cubes. Put 
them into a pot with water and salt and let them simmer 
for 12-15 minutes. 
2.	 Next, place the chicken into a zip-lock bag and pound 	
	
	
it with a heavy object, like a pan, to flatten it. Remove the 		
	
chicken from the bag, and season it with salt, black pepper, 	
	
oregano, and garlic powder. Peel and grate the garlic.
3.	 Set a 24cm (9.5-inch) pan on the stove over medium-	 	
	
high heat. Fry the chicken, flipping it every 60-90 	
	
	
seconds, until it‘s cooked through—about 4-5 minutes. 	
	
Then, remove the chicken from the pan.
4.	 Add oil to the same pan, and sauté the garlic for 20-30 	
	
seconds. Next, add the tomatoes and a splash of water, 	
	
cover with a lid, and let it simmer for 2-3 minutes.
5.	 Press the tomatoes down to release their juices. Season 	
	
with salt, pepper, and chili flakes, and give it a good stir.
6.	 Pour in the chicken stock and evaporated milk, letting it 	
	
all simmer for another 1-2 minutes.
7.	 Return the chicken to the pan to reheat it.
8.	 To serve, plate the potatoes and top them with the 	
	
	
chicken and sauce. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 This recipe typically calls for sun-dried tomatoes, but I find 
it tastes much better with fresh ones. However, feel free to 
experiment with sun-dried tomatoes if you prefer; the rest of 
the recipe remains the same.
