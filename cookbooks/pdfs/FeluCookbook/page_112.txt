AIR FRYER CHICKEN
& CRISPY POTATOES
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Clean the potatoes and peel them, in this case peeling 
them will make it crunchier. Then cut them into chunks.
2.	 Prepare the chicken as described in the chapter  
“How to tenderize chicken breast”.
3.	 Add the water to a pot and bring to a boil. Add baking 
soda and a couple of teaspoons  salt. Add in the  
potatoes and let them simmer for 10 minutes.
4.	 Rinse the potatoes and add them to a bowl. 
5.	 Add oil and black pepper. Shake the bowl for around 30 
seconds, so the surface of the potatoes starts to break, 
and the surface of the bowl gets coded with a slurry.
6.	 Bake the potatoes in the air fryer at 180°C or 350°F  
for 15 minutes.
7.	 After 15 minutes, flip the potatoes and keep baking  
them for another 15 minutes.
8.	 Add salt, pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper  
to a glass and mix.
9.	 Add 2g of oil to the chicken breast and cover it with  
garlic powder and cayenne pepper.
10.	Add chicken to the air fryer for the last 10-12 minutes. 	 	
	
If you don‘t have space for everything in your air fryer 	 	
	
you can fry the chicken in a pan or bake it in the oven. 
11.	Use a food thermometer to prevent overbaking the chicken.
12.	Add everything to a plate. Done!
N O T E S :
•	Avocado Greek yogurt dip is perfect as a  
dipping sauce for this recipe.
