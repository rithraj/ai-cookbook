PUDDING OATS 
CHOC
 If you love chocolate, then you’re  
 going to fall in love with this heavenly  
 dessert. Let me introduce you to 
 chocolate pudding oats. 
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 In a pot, add the oats, water, sweetener and  
a pinch of salt. On medium heat,  
start to gently heat the oats on a stove.
2.	 Stir occasionally for 2 minutes until  
the oatmeal becomes thick. 
3.	 Mix the pudding powder, cocoa,  
peanut powder and milk in a glass and  
stir well to prevent any lumps.
4.	 Add the pudding and milk to the pot of 
oatmeal and keep stirring for about 1 minute,  
or until the oatmeal becomes thick once again.
5.	 Remove from the heat and  
transfer everything to a bowl. 
6.	 Mix in skyr. Eat right away or refrigerate  
overnight for overnight oats.
N O T E S :
•	Cover the surface with plastic wrap before  
refrigerating to prevent a skin from forming.  
The wrap needs to touch the oats.
•	Mix 15 g of vanilla Casein with 50 g water and  
add in on top for more protein.
