RISOTTO
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  5  S E R V I N G S :
350 g

900 g 	 	
skinless,

1000 g

15 g

3

600 g

20 g 	
	
olive oil
6 g 	
	
garlic powder
20 g 	
	
fresh rosemary
Salt and black pepper
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Cut the chicken into chunks and place them in a bowl. Add 10g 		
	
of olive oil and season with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder.
2.	 Chop the onions and mushrooms into small, bite-sized pieces. 	 	
	
Grate the Parmesan cheese, and finely chop the rosemary.
3.	 In a large glass, combine 1000g of water with stock powder.
4.	 Heat a pan over medium-high heat and sear the chicken chunks 	
	
for 1 minute on each side, then remove them from the pan.
5.	 In the same pan, add the mushrooms with a splash of water and 	
	
cook for about 7 minutes, until the water has evaporated. Then 		
	
add 5g of olive oil and stir-fry for an additional 5 minutes. 
6.	 Add the onions along with another 5g of olive oil and a pinch of 	
	
salt, and stir-fry for 3 more minutes.
7.	 Combine everything in the pan, then return the chicken to the 		
	
pan. Cover with a lid and let it simmer over medium-low heat for 	
	
30 minutes.
8.	 Next, stir in the rice and rosemary, and toast for about 1 minute. 	
	
Then add the broth and return the chicken to the pan. Cover 	 	
	
again and let it simmer on medium-low heat for 20–25 minutes.
9.	 Check the pan every 7–8 minutes to ensure there is enough 	
	
	
liquid. If the liquid evaporates before the rice is fully cooked, add 	
	
more stock as needed. 
10.	Once the rice is cooked, remove the pan from the heat, stir in 	 	
	
the Parmesan cheese, and then portion the dish into 5 meal-	
	
	
prep containers. Refrigerate for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 3 	
	
months..
N O T E S :
•	 Arborio or Carnaroli rice works best, but any rice will do.
•	 Don’t rinse the rice for risotto; the starch is needed to make the 	
	 dish creamy.
