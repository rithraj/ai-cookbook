D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Cut the lemongrass stem into 3-4 pieces.  
Smash with the flat part of your knife, so it cracks a bit.
2.	 Add the lemongrass, rice, and 125 g water to a pot  
(18cm or 7inch diameter) with a pinch  salt.
3.	 Put on the stove on a high heat. Wait until the water 
starts to boil, before turning down the heat to low.  
Close the lid and let it simmer for 12-15 mins.
4.	 While the rice is cooking, chop up the onion  
and pepper into equal bite-sized pieces.
5.	 Cut the chicken into strips. Add 2 g of oil on the chicken 
and spread the Cajun seasoning on top. Mix with your 
hands so that the seasoning coats the entire chicken.
6.	 Put a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on the stove on medium-high 
heat and fry the chicken for 60-90 seconds on each side 
just until they turn brown in color.
7.	 Remove the chicken from the pan, add 2 g of oil to the 
pan, turn the heat down to medium and fry the onion 
and pepper for 4-5 minutes until caramelized.
8.	 Add the chicken back to the pan along with the milk 
and laughing low cheese. Mix everything with a spatula, 
smashing the cheese wedge, so it gets incorporated into 
the sauce. Simmer for 1 more minute.
9.	 Add rice into a bowl and add the cajun chicken on top. 
Done!
