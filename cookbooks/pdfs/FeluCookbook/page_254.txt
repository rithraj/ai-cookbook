D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Peel and cut the potatoes into thick slices, then into fries 	
	
and then again into bite-size cubes. 2x2cm or 1x1 inch.
2.	 Microwave the potatoes in a bowl for 5 min at 600W.
3.	 Dice the onion and cut the deli meat into bite-size pieces. Crack 
the eggs into a bowl and mix them with a fork.
4.	 Add oil to a pan over medium heat and add the microwaved 	 	
	
potatoes with a pinch of salt. Fry them for 5-7 minutes, stirring 	
	
occasionally, until they are slightly golden brown.
5.	 Add a bit more oil and then add the onion and deli meat. 	
	
	
Continue frying, stirring occasionally, for another 3-5 minutes.
6.	 Add cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper, and mix 	
	
	
everything for 30 seconds.
7.	 Now add the eggs and cook them for about 1 minute until they 	
	
are cooked through.
8.	 Transfer everything onto 2 plates to cool down for 15-20 	
	
	
minutes. If you wrap them now, the burritos will become soggy.
9.	 Meanwhile, make the mint sauce (see chapter).
10.	Prepare 5 tortillas. Separate everything from the pan evenly, 	 	
	
add 15g of mozzarella on top of each tortilla, and add 5g of mint 	
	
sauce per tortilla as well. Wrap the tortillas into 5 burritos, then 	
	
cover them with a paper towel and put them into a zip-lock 	
	
	
bag. Store them in the freezer for up to 3 months.
11.	When ready to eat, take them out of the freezer and microwave 	
	
for 3-4 minutes. They will be ready to enjoy!
