D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Preheat the oven to 180°C or 350°F.
2.	 Chop up the tomato and spinach into  
very small pieces.
3.	 Add all the ingredients, except the eggs,  
into a bowl and mix everything until combined.
4.	 Distribute the vegetables/cheese mix into  
6 muffin cases (Diameter 7cm or 3inch).
5.	 Crack 1 egg into every muffin case and whisk  
all of them with a fork until combined.
6.	 Bake the egg bites for 15-18 minutes.
7.	 Remove them from the muffin tin and  
immediately eat or store in the fridge.
N O T E S :
•	You can get creative with the spices for different 
flavor combinations. Paprika, smoked paprika,  
turmeric, and cayenne pepper all work great.
•	Change the cheese to 25 g of shredded cheddar  
for a taste twist. This recipe will have 30 more  
calories with cheddar.
