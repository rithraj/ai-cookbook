JUICY
MEATBALLS
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
180 g 	 	
ground beef 95/5
1 	
	
slice sandwich bread
½ 	
	
medium onion or 25 g 
25 g 	
	
egg whites
50 g 	
	
buttermilk
9 g 	
	
dry gelatine
5 g 	
	
parsley
2 g 	
	
chili powder
2 g 	
	
paprika
Salt and black pepper
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Preheat the oven to 180°C or 350°F.
2.	 Add buttermilk and gelatine into a glass  
and mix until combined. Set it aside.
3.	 Dice the onion into very small pieces. Peel and grate garlic. 
Remove the crust from the bread and cut it into small cubes. 
Chop up parsley.
4.	 Place the bowl on a scale. Add in beef, egg whites, garlic,  
onions, bread, parsley, seasonings, and buttermilk.
5.	 Mix everything with your hands until it becomes  
one humongous meatball.
6.	 To check the seasoning, take a small piece  the meat  
and place it into a microwave-safe container.  
Microwave the meat on high for 15 seconds and taste it.  
Add seasoning to raw meatballs if needed.
7.	 Spray oil into a baking dish. Form small  
meatballs and place them into the dish. The size is a personal 
preference. Bigger balls will take longer to bake.
8.	 Once the entire meat is formed into small balls, place the  
baking dish into the oven and bake for 15-18 minutes.
9.	 You can immediately eat them or add oil to a pan on high  
heat and add meatballs. Fry them for 1 minute to develop 
extra browning on the outside. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 You can add 25g  grated Parmesan for extra flavor.  
It will add 100 extra calories.
•	 Meatballs can be meal-prepped and last in the fridge for 3-4 days.
