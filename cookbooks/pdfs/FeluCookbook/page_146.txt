AIR FRYER
CHICKEN NUGGETS
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
1	
	
chicken breast or 180 g
5 g 	
	
flour 
30 g 	
	
egg whites
25 g 	
	
cornflakes
1 g 	
	
cayenne pepper
1 g	
	
smoked paprika
Salt and black pepper
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by dry-brining the chicken as described in 	 	
	
the chapter „How to Cook a Juicy Chicken Breast.“
2.	 After brining, cut the chicken into nuggets. The 	 	
	
size of the nuggets will dictate the baking time, 	 	
	
with thicker nuggets needing longer in the air 	
	
	
fryer or oven.
3.	 To create the breading, add cornflakes to a ziplock 	
	
bag and crush them into a rough powder using a 		
	
heavy pot.
4.	 Set up three separate bowls containing flour, egg 		
	
whites, and crushed cornflakes. Dip each piece of 	
	
chicken into the bowls in that order, making sure 		
	
that each piece is fully coated with breading.
5.	 Place the chicken into the air fryer basket and 	
	
	
spray some oil on top. Flip the chicken and add 	 	
	
another spritz of oil.
6.	 Set the air fryer to 200°C or 400°F and cook for 	 	
	
8-12 minutes. Use a food thermometer to ensure 		
	
that the internal temperature of the chicken 	
	
	
reaches 74°C or 165°F to be safe.
N O T E S :
•	As a dipping sauce I recommend using the ranch 	 	
	 sauce or the PB sauce from this book, see chapter.
