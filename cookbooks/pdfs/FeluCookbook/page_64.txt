D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by making 1 serving of 2-ingredient dough.
2.	 Add a bit of oil to a pan (25cm/10 inches) and 	
	
	
place the dough ball in it. Now, shape the dough 	 	
	
into a round pizza by pressing it down and pushing 	
	
out the edges.
3.	 Turn the heat to medium and cook the bottom of 	
	
the dough for 3-4 minutes. Then, flip the dough 	 	
	
and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
4.	 Next, spread the tomato sauce on top, followed by 	
	
the deli meat, and finally the cheese.
5.	 Put the pizza under the broiler for 1 minute until 	 	
	
the cheese is fully melted. Done!
N O T E S :
•	You can change up the toppings and use tuna with 
onions or a vegetabrian pizza for more volume!
