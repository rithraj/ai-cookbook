D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop up the onion into small pieces. Add to a glass soy 	
	
sauce, gochujang, and honey and mix.
2.	 Place a pan (25cm/10inch) on the stove on  
medium-high heat.
3.	 Start with frying the onion in a bit of oil for 2-3 minutes. 
4.	 Add the beef with another touch of oil and keep frying for 
another 2 minutes under occasional stirring. Try to separa-
te the beef with a spatula.
5.	 Add in cumin and garlic powder and toast the spices for 
30 seconds.
6.	 Add the sauce and mix everything, then crack in the egg 	
	
and immediately add the cheese. Give everything a stir 	
	
and then lay the tortilla on top of the meat and cheese 		
	
mixture.
7.	 Place a plate on top of the tortilla and flip the pan. Lay 
the tortilla with the other side back to the pan.
8.	 Flip one side of the tortilla on top of the other to form  
a quesadilla, and press it down gently with your spatula. 
9.	 Salt the outside of the tortilla and fry both  
sides for about 30 seconds. Done!
