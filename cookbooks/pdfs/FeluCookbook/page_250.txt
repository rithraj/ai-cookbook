D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop up all vegetables and the mushrooms  
into bitesize pieces, peel and grate the garlic. 
2.	 Add water with broth powder and gelatine  
into a container and mix until combined.
3.	 Add mushrooms with 50g  water to a pan (28 cm or  
11 inch) on medium-high heat. Let it saute until the  
mushrooms have collapsed. Add 2g of oil and keep  
frying until mushrooms get color, around 4-5 minutes.
4.	 Make space in the pan (28cm/11inch) and add 2g of oil.  
Add the beef. Add a pinch  salt and black pepper.  
Fry the beef for 2-3 minutes.
5.	 Add vegetables and fry everything under occasional  
stirring for 7-8 minutes. Add garlic and fry for 20 seconds.
6.	 Add tomato puree, keep frying for 30 seconds,  
and then add peas.
7.	 Now add in the broth, mix everything,  
cover the lid and let it simmer for 15 minutes.
8.	 In the meantime, make the cauliflower mash  
(find this recipe in the cauliflower mash chapter).  
Preheat the oven to 200°C or 400°F.
9.	 Fill a baking dish (I use 20x20cm) with the meat sauce at 
the bottom. Cover with cauliflower mash and top it with 
gouda cheese.
10.	Bake for 10-15 minutes. Done!
