 Beef, potatoes and cheese might be one 
 of my all time favorite combinations, 
 especially when packed with protein.

D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start with making the fries.  
See the chapter on Crispy air fryer potatoes.
2.	 While the potatoes are baking, add into a blender  
cottage cheese, american cheese, milk, a pinch of salt,  
black pepper, and garlic powder into a blender  
and mix for 20 seconds until smooth.
3.	 10 minutes before the potatoes are ready, heat a pan 
(24cm/9,5inch) on medium heat, add in oil and add  
onions. Fry the onions for 2-5 min until caramelized. 
4.	 Switch to medium-high, add in the beef and keep  
frying for 1-2 minutes with occasional stirring until  
the beef is browned. Add Jalapenos, cumin and chilli  
powder, and keep stirring for another 30 seconds.
5.	 Heat up the cheese sauce in the microwave for  
20 seconds just until it is warm.
6.	 Add fries to a plate, top with beef and then  
cheese sauce. Enjoy!
N O T E S :
•	You can also make separate sauteed onions to add on  
top like I did in the picture, but I would rather make  
them with the beef to save dishes and time.
