D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Dice onion and prepare other ingredients.
2.	 Preheat a pan (28cm or 11 inches) over 
medium heat and add oil. Start by fry-
ing the onions with a pinch of salt for 2-3 
minutes.
3.	 Push the onions aside, add more oil, and 		
	
then add the ground beef. Use a 	 	
	
	
spatula to spread the beef, ensuring 	
	
	
as much meat as possible comes into 	
	
	
contact with the pan.
4.	 Fry the beef for 1 minute, then 	
	
	
	
add all the seasonings. Mix everything 	
	
	
and toast the seasonings for 15 seconds.
5.	 Add the tomato puree and fry it for 15 	
	
	
seconds. Next, add the tomato sauce 	
	
	
with a splash of water, and mix. Allow it to 	
	
simmer for 1-2 minutes until it thickens.
6.	 Remove from the heat and transfer 	
	
	
everything to a meal prep container. Let it 	
	
cool down for a few minutes before 	
	
	
storing it in the fridge.  Done!
