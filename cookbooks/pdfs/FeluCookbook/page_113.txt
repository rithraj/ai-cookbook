chicken with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
2.	 Place the chicken in the oven for 12-15 min  
at 180°C or 350°F.
3.	 Add all sauce ingredients into a glass  
and mix until smooth.
4.	 Add oil to a pan (24cm/9,5inch) and switch the 
heat to medium-high. Cut the buns open and add 
them to the pan to give them a slight toast.  
15-20 seconds should be enough.  
Be cautious not to burn them.
5.	 Cut toppings that you would like to add to your 
bun, such as tomatoes, onions, or lettuce.
6.	 As soon as the chicken is done, remove it from the 
oven, and cut it in half. Add cheese on top of 1 half 
thigh and add the other half on top to melt the 
cheese.
7.	 Add half the sauce on the bottom side of the bun. 
And add chicken, then toppings, then the rest of 
the sauce, and then the top bun. Done!
N O T E S :
•	Alternatively use the air fryer for the chicken thigh.  
sauce for some sweetness.
