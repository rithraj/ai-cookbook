D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Add the rice with a pinch of salt to a pot (18cm or 7inch 
diameter). Pour in the water and close the lid.
2.	 Place it on a stove on high heat until it starts boiling. 
Turn down the heat to low and let it simmer for  
12-15 minutes.
3.	 Mix all sauce ingredients in a small glass until smooth.
4.	 Slice the steak into bite-sized cubes and add them to a 	
	
bowl. Then add oil, garlic powder, smoked paprika, 	
	
	
cayenne pepper, black pepper, and a pinch of salt.
5.	 Peel the avocado and slice it, and peel the cucumber 	 	
	
and cut it into smaller pieces as well.
6.	 Heat a pan over medium heat and fry the beef for 2-3 		
	
minutes, stirring occasionally, until it has browned 	
	
	
but is still pink inside. Add the frozen peas and 	
	
	
keep stirring 	for 30 seconds, then remove the pan from 	
	
the heat.
7.	 In a bowl, mix the cooked rice with chopped cilantro and 
lime juice. Top with the beef, avocado, cucumber, and 
drizzle the sauce on top. Done
