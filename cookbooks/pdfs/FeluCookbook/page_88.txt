1.	 Chop up the vegetables and cut the chicken into strips. 
	
Add soy sauce, oyster sauce, honey, and cornstarch into 	
	
a small bowl and mix until smooth.
2.	 Fill a pot with water and turn the heat on high. Add the 
noodles and let them cook for 10-12 minutes.
3.	 Add oil to a pan (24cm/9.5 inches) and fry the vegetables 
with a pinch of salt for 3 minutes on medium-high heat.
4.	 Push the vegetables to the side, add a bit more oil, and 
then the chicken. Add a pinch of salt, black pepper, and 
garlic powder. After one minute, flip the chicken and let it 
brown for another minute. 
5.	 Give everything a good stir.
6.	 Drain the noodles and add them with the sauce into the 	
	
pan. Give everything another stir, and you‘re done!
N O T E S :
•	The sauce can be changed as long as you stick with East 
Asian style ingredients. Try to experiment with hoisin or 
gochujang.
