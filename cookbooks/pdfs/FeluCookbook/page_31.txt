D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop up the onion and jalapeno. Peel and grate the garlic. 	
	
	
Chop the deli meat into small cubes. 
2.	 Halve the tomato and grate it on a box grater into a puree. 	
	
	
Throw away the skin. You don’t have to cook the tomatoes	
	
	
before grating.
3.	 Heat up a pan (18 cm or 7 inches) over medium heat and add 	 	
	
the oil. Start by frying the onion and jalapenos, stirring occasio-	
	
nally, for 3-4 minutes. Add a pinch of salt.
4.	 Add a bit more oil and fry the garlic for 20 seconds. Then add 
the tomatoes and stir everything. Add black pepper and soy 
sauce and continue to simmer for 2-3 minutes until thick.
5.	 Meanwhile, heat up the tortilla in a dry pan for 30-45 seconds 	
	
on each side and then put it on a plate.
6.	 Add oil to the pan on medium-high heat and start frying the 	 	
	
deli meat for around 1-2 minutes until brown. Add the egg 	
	
	
whites and immediately start stirring for around 30 seconds 	
	
	
under constant mixing. Place the cooked egg whites on top of 	
	
the tortilla.
7.	 Add another touch of oil into the pan and crack in the egg. 	
	
	
Cook it for 1 minute with a closed lid. Add a small pinch of 	
	
	
salt and black pepper.
8.	 Place the egg on top of the egg whites and then add the toma	
	
to sauce on top of the eggs. Add a bunch of chopped cilantro 	
	
on top. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 You can meal prep the tomato sauce and store it in the fridge 	
	 for 2-3 days to turn this into a 5-minute breakfast.
