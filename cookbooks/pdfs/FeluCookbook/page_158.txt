I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
180 g

250 g 	 	
potatoes
1 	
	
red bell pepper or 150 g
1 	
	
medium onion or 50 g
1 g

50 g

50 g

1 g

D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Peel and cut the potatoes into thick slices, then into fries 	 	
	
and then again into bite-size cubes. 2x2cm or 1x1 inch.
2.	 Microwave the potatoes in a bowl for 5 min at 600W.
3.	 Dice the onion and bell pepper.
4.	 Add oil to a pan over medium heat and start by frying the 		
	
microwaved potatoes for 5 minutes with a pinch of salt. 
5.	 Then, add a bit more oil and add the pepper and onion 	
	
	
with another small pinch of salt. Continue frying for another 	
	
3 minutes before adding a bit more oil and adding the 	
	
	
ground beef. Spread the beef so that as much meat 	
	
	
as possible comes in contact with the pan. Fry the beef for 1 	
	
minute.
6.	 Add black pepper, garlic powder, and chili powder. Mix 	
	
	
everything and continue frying for another 1-2 minutes 	
	
	
until the beef is cooked through.
7.	 Meanwhile, add cottage cheese, tomato salsa, 	
	
	
	
evaporated milk, salt, and oregano to a blender. Blend 	
	
	
on high for 60 seconds.
8.	 Remove the beef from the heat and add the sauce to the pan, 	
	
using the remaining heat to bring the sauce to temperature 	 	
	
and mix everything together. Done!
N O T E S :
•	Use different spices like cayenne pepper or turmeric and 	
	 add it to the pan for more flavor.
•	The sauce can be also prepared with 10g of tomato puree.
