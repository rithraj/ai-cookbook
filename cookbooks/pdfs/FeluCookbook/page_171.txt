1. Start by placing a bowl on a  scale.
2. Add all ingredients except the toppings.
3. Mix until creamy and smooth for 30 seconds. 
Using casein is important but not mandatory, 
so don’t worry if you haven’t got it.  
You can also add whey but it won’t be as 
creamy and thick even after refrigerating.
4. Cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight.
5. In the morning, peel and slice a banana.  
Roughly chop up the walnuts.  
Top with the oats. 
6. You’re done! Breakfast is served!
N O T E S :
•	Milk can be used instead of water,  
but please track the additional calories.
•	To lower calories, you can add strawberries  
as a topping instead of the banana and nuts.
•	Powdered peanuts can be replaced with  
10 g of regular peanut butter.
•	Steelcut oats can be used instead of instant  
oats which will result in a crunchier texture.
