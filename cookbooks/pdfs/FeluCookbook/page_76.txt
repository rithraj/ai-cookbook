fries and then again into bite-size cubes. 2x2cm or 1x1 
inch.

Add a little oil and fry the microwaved potatoes with a 
pinch of salt for 3–4 minutes, stirring occasionally.

more oil. Then add the chicken along with a pinch of 	
	
	
salt. Stir-fry the chicken for 1 minute on each side.
7.	 Add the seasonings (from the bowl) to the pan and stir 		
	
everything to coat the chicken and potatoes. Then re	 	
	
move the pan from the heat.

green sauce and mix well. Done!
