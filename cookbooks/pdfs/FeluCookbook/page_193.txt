D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by grinding the oats in a blender for about  
60 seconds or until it becomes oat flour.
2.	 Next, place a bowl on your scale.
3.	 Add all the dry ingredients to the bowl.  
Whisk everything for 10-15 secs.
4.	 Place a second bowl on the scale.
5.	 Add all wet ingredients into the second bowl  
and mix until combined.
6.	 Add the wet ingredients to the dry and slowly  
whisk until smooth in texture. Add a small  
splash of water if it sticks.
7.	 Place parchment paper onto a baking sheet 
(20x20cm or 8x8inch).
8.	 Transfer the batter to a baking sheet and bake  
for 25-30 min at 180°C or 350°F.
9.	 After baking, remove the cake from the baking  
sheet and let it cool down for about 15 min.
10.	Slice, serve and enjoy with maple syrup  
or/and Greek yogurt.
N O T E S :
•	Whey/Casein blend works best in this recipe.
•	Oat flour can be replaced by all-purpose flour.
•	Add a bit of water if the batter is dry.  
That is because of the casein.
