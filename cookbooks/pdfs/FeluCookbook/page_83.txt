D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop all vegetables into bite-sized pieces. Grate the 	 	
	
clove of garlic. Slice the chicken breast into thin pieces.
2.	 Add all sauce ingredients to a small glass and mix until 
combined. 
3.	 Fill a pot with salted water and bring to a boil. Add the 		
	
broccoli and cook for 3 minutes on high heat. Then, 	
	
	
remove the broccoli and add the noodles, letting them 		
	
simmer for 12-15 minutes.
4.	 Heat 3g of oil in a 24 cm (9.5-inch) pan over medium-
high heat. Add the chicken and fry for 2 minutes, stirring 
occasionally. 
5.	 Remove the chicken from the pan and add a bit more 
oil. Add the onions and bell pepper, seasoning with salt 
and black pepper, and sauté for 3 minutes.
6.	 Add the cooked broccoli and fry for another 2 minutes. 	
	
Then, add the grated garlic and stir for 15 seconds.
7.	 Crack in the eggs and give them a quick stir before 	
	
	
adding the sauce and the cooked, drained noodles.
8.	 Let everything simmer for 1 minute, then add the chi-
cken back in and cook for 1 more minute. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 The sauce can be changed as long as you stick to East Asian 
flavors. Try to experiment with Mirin or Gochujang.
•	 This recipe also works well with ground beef instead of 	
	
	 chicken.
