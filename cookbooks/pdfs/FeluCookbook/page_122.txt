D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop up all vegetables into small pieces.
2.	 Place a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on the stove on  
medium-high heat with 2 g of oil.
3.	 Start with frying the onion for 2-3 minutes. 
4.	 Add the beef and keep frying for another 2 minutes under 
occasional stirring. Try to separate the beef with a spatula.
5.	 Add in tomatoes and jalapenos and fry them for  
1-2 minutes—season with salt and pepper.
6.	 Lay the tortilla on a plate beside the pan.
7.	 Add Mozzarella to the pan and combine everything until 
the cheese is melted. This will take about 30 seconds.
8.	 Transfer the meat to the tortilla you prepared.  
Take the tortilla and put it back into the pan,  
bottom side down.
9.	 Add the mint sauce on top of the meat.
10.	Flip one side of the tortilla on top of the other to form  
a quesadilla, and press it down gently with your spatula. 
11.	Salt the outside of the tortilla and fry both  
sides for about 30 seconds. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 You can swap out the sauce for something else you like,  
   like ketchup or sriracha.
