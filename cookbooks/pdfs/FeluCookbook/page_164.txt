D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop the onion, chili, and peel and grate the garlic. Cut the 
broccoli florets into bite-size pieces.
2.	 In a glass, mix vinegar, soy sauce, water, and honey.
3.	 In a pan over medium heat, add oil and fry the onion for 3 	
	
	
minutes, stirring occasionally.
4.	 Push the onions to the side of the pan, add more oil, and add 		
	
the chicken thighs. Fry both sides for 1-2 minutes to get some 	
	
color. Add black pepper.
5.	 As soon as the chicken has color, add all other ingredients, mix 	
	
everything, and close the lid. Reduce heat to low and let it 	
	
	
simmer for 15 minutes.
6.	 After 15 minutes, flip the chicken and give the vegetables a stir. 	
	
Close the lid again and let it simmer for 10 more minutes.
7.	 After 25 minutes, check the sauce for seasoning and thickness. 	
	
If it‘s too thin, add a starch slurry. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 50 g of raw jasmine rice will add another 175 calories.
•	 Chicken thighs are hard to overcook, so don’t worry  
if you let it simmer a bit longer to be safe.
•	 This dish can also be made with black pepper corns instead of 	 	
	 cracked pepper.
