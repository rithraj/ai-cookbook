D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by making 1 serving of two-ingredient dough naan 
bread (see chapter) or prepare a store-bought pita.
2.	 Cut the chicken breast into bite-size pieces. Then, 
optionally, marinate the chicken (see the chapter on 
washing and marinating meat).
3.	 Chop up the onion and bell pepper into small bite-size 	
	
pieces. Mix in a glass of soy sauce, honey, cornstarch, 	 	
	
and rice vinegar.
4.	 Add oil to a pan on medium heat and start by frying 	
	
	
the onion and bell pepper for 3 minutes under 		
	
	
occasional stirring. Add a pinch of salt.
5.	 Push the vegetables to the side of the pan, add a bit 	
	
	
of oil, and add in the chicken. Fry the chicken under 	
	
	
occasional stirring for 2 minutes.
6.	 Add in the sauce, mix everything, and let it simmer for 		
	
just 30 seconds until sauce is thick.
7.	 Add cream cheese as a bottom layer on the naan bread. 	
	
Then add the teriyaki chicken on top and fold the wrap. 	
	
Done!
N O T E S :
•	If you buy a pita, try to shoot for 200 calories max.
•	If the sauce isn‘t thick enough when cooking add a bit 	
	
	 of starch slurry. It consists of 50g water and 2g cornstarch 	
	 mixed in a glas.
