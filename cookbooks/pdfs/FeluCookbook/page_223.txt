D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Preheat the oven to 180°C or 350°F. 
Then start by placing a bowl on your scale. 
2.	 Taste the yogurt before adding it, just to see  
if you need sweetener in the cake. 
3.	 Add 25g sweetener into the bowl if needed. Then add 
in the yogurt, egg, and pudding powder and mix until 
smooth. You can choose whatever flavor you want,  
I tend to make it with strawberry yogurt and vanilla  
pudding or vice versa. 
4.	 Add parchment paper to a baking dish.  
(15cm or 6inch diameter).
5.	 Transfer the batter to the baking dish and  
bake in the oven for 30-35 min.
6.	 Remove and place the cake on a plate to allow it to cool 
for 15 mins. Refrigerate the cake for 1 hour or until it has 
set. Overnight is also an option. 
7.	 Top with one serving powdered peanuts. Done! 
 
N O T E S :
•	This can be meal prepped for 3-5 days.
•	If you have only access to plain yogurt add 1/2 scoop of 
protein powder to add extra flavor.
•	You can make a bigger cake by doubling or even tripling 
the ingredients. However, I would reduce the baking temp 
to 160°C or 320°F and prolong the baking by 10-15 minutes.
•	You can use 50 g egg whites instead  1 whole egg  
to save 50 calories.
