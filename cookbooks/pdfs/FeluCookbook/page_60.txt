D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Rinse the rice under cold water to remove excess starch. 
Add rice with 125g of water and a pinch of salt into a pot 
(18cm or 7inch diameter).
2.	 Put the pot on a stove on high heat. As soon the water 
starts to boil, reduce the heat to low, close the lid and  
let it simmer for 12-15 minutes.
3.	 Cut chicken breast, onion, pepper and carrot into  
bite size pieces.
4.	 Preheat a pan to medium-high heat, and add 2g of oil      
before adding the chicken. 
5.	 Fry chicken on both sides for 60 seconds.  
Remove it from the pan and place on a plate even if the 
chicken is not fully cooked.
6.	 Add 2g of oil again to the same pan. Add in carrot, 
onion and pepper and fry under occasional stirring  
for 3-5 minutes.
7.	 Add in garlic and ginger and keep frying for 20 seconds. 
8.	 Add cooked rice to the pan and stir everything.  
Keep frying for another 1-2 minutes.
9.	 Now add the egg and keep frying for a further minute. 
10.	Next comes the peas with black pepper. Mix everything 
together.
11.	 Add the chicken back to the pan with soy sauce and keep 
frying for 30 seconds until the chicken is hot again. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 After cooking, let the rice sit in the hot pot to remove all  
the liquid. This will help make the rice less clumpy.
•	 If you have left over rice the recipe works even better.
