ITALIAN CREAMY 
BURRITO
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop up the onion into small pieces.  
Peel and grate garlic.
2.	 Add oil into the pan (24cm/9,5inch) on medium-high 
heat. Add the onion and fry for 3 minutes, then add 
ground beef and fry both for another 1-2 minutes under 
occasional stirring until beef has some color. Add a pinch 
of salt and black pepper.
3.	 Add in garlic and fry for 20 seconds. 
4.	 Add tomato sauce and mix everything,  
so all the meat is red.
5.	 Add the laughing cow wedge, turn the heat to medium-
low and mix the cheese slowly into the sauce by pressing 
it down with a spatula for around 1 minute.
6.	 Once the sauce is creamy, add in the gouda  
cheese and melt it in for around 30 seconds.
7.	 Add another pan to the stove. Dry cook the tortillas for 
30 seconds on each side on medium-high. Add some 
salt to them.
8.	 Assemble burritos by laying half the meat mixture into 
one tortilla. I just roll them like a cigar, but you can also 
lay both sides left and right towards the middle and then 
roll it into a closed burrito shape. Done!
N O T E S :
•	The recipe can also be divided in half for a smaller serving, 
apart from the laughing low wedge.
