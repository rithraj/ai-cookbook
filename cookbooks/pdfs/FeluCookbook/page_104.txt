D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 In a bowl, combine flour, garlic powder, onion powder, 	 	
	
baking powder, and a pinch of salt. Mix these 	 	
	
	
ingredients. Then, add skyr and honey, and 	
	
	
	
knead with your hands until you form a dough ball.
2.	 In a small bowl, add olive oil. Grate the garlic into the 	 	
	
bowl, chop the parsley, and add it as well. Mix until 	
	
	
combined.
3.	 Chop the deli meat into fine pieces.
4.	 Cut the dough ball into four equal pieces. Lay a large 	 	
	
piece of parchment paper on your board, drizzle some 		
	
oil on it, and spread the oil around with your hand. Place 	
	
the dough balls on the parchment paper and press them 	
	
flat to form small tortilla shapes.
5.	 Fill each tortilla with an equal amount of cheese and 	
	
	
meat. Then fold one side of each tortilla over to create 		
	
four small calzones.
6.	 Place the calzones in a pan over medium heat and cook 	
	
on both sides with a closed lid for 2-3 minutes until they 	
	
turn golden brown.
7.	 Now, spread the infused olive oil on top of all the 	
	
	
calzones in the pan and continue frying for another 30 		
	
seconds. Done!
N O T E S :
•	You can store the calzones in the freezer for up to 3 
months.
