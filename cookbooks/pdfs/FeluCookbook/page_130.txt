ONEPOT
BEEF CURRY
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Dice onion, peel and grate garlic, and cut mushrooms  
into bite-size pieces. Mix water with broth powder  
and optional gelatine in a glass.
2.	 Add mushrooms with 50g of water into a pan 
(24cm/9,5inch) on medium-high heat.  
Let it saute until mushrooms collapse, 3-4 minutes. 
3.	 Add 2g of oil and keep frying until mushrooms  
get color, around 4-5 minutes.
4.	 Make space in the pan and add 2 g of oil and add  
in the onions. Keep frying for another 3-4 minutes.
5.	 Add in beef and keep frying for another  
1-2 minutes until the beef gets color.
6.	 Add garlic and fry for 20 seconds.
7.	 Add rice, curry powder, salt, pepper and broth.  
Combine everything and let it simmer on low heat  
until the rice is cooked through. 12-15 minutes. Done!
N O T E S :
•	You can also cook the rice separately and add it after the 
beef is cooked. But then only add a splash of water to the 
beef to incorporate the curry better.
•	Instant rice is an option as well for even faster results.  
Add it at the end of the recipe with a splash of water.
