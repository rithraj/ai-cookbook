 Carrot cake is a classic dessert so why   
 not make a high protein version that 
 you can eat every day? 
ESTIMATED TIME: 40 MIN
CARROT 
CAKE
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Grind the oats in a food processor or blender for 
roughly 60 seconds or until it becomes oat flour.
2.	 Place a bowl on your scale. 
3.	 Add all dry ingredients to a bowl and mix.
4.	 Place a second bowl on the scale and add all the 
wet ingredients and carrots. Mix together.
5.	 Add the wet to the dry ingredients and  
mix until smooth.
6.	 Place parchment paper on a baking tray  
(24cm or 9inch diameter).
7.	 Transfer the batter to the baking tray and bake 
for 30-35 min at 180°C or 350°F.
8.	 Allow the cake to cool for 15 min.
9.	 Slice, serve, and enjoy. This tasty cake lasts in  
the fridge for 2-3 days.
N O T E S :
•	Carrots can be reduced by 100 g.  
If you choose to do this, then I would recommend 
adding another 30 g of oats to add volume.
