D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Cook the pasta in salted water for 3 minutes longer than 	 	
	
the package instructions, then drain it as soon as it’s done.
2.	 Chop up all vegetables and deli meat into bite-sized pieces.
3.	 In a small bowl (or glass), combine the light mayo, skyr, lime 	
	
juice, olive oil, garlic powder, and salt; mix well.
4.	 Place a bowl on a scale and add the frozen edamame. Then 	
	
add the drained pasta and stir—it will defrost the edamame 	
	
and cool down the pasta.
5.	 Add the vegetables, deli meat, and sauce, and give 	
	
	
everything a good stir. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 You can add cayenne pepper and onion powder to the  
sauce for more flavor.
•	 Dor the deli meat I use turkey, it is the best in my opinion.
