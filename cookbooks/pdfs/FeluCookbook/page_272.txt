D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop up the onions, carrots and  
celery into small pieces.
2.	 Add water to a bowl with broth powder and  
dry gelatine. Mix until combined.
3.	 Add oil to a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on medium heat. 
Start frying the vegetables for 3-4 minutes  
under occasional stirring.
4.	 Add in the beef, and switch the heat to medium-
high and keep frying for additional 2-3 minutes 
until the beef has brown spots.
5.	 Add in tomato puree, a pinch of salt and black 
pepper. Keep stirring the puree into the meat for 
another minute.
6.	 Add in the broth, mix until everything is combined, 
reduce the heat to medium-low and let it simmer 
without a lid for 20 minutes. Done!
N O T E S :
•	You can also start frying the beef and add the 
vegetables afterwards. There is no right or wrong 
answers here. Try both versions and see which one 
you like more.
•	The gelatine will make the texture rich in your 
mouth, even with extra lean ground beef.
