1.	 Chop the onion and pak choi. Add all the sauce 	 	
	
ingredients into a small bowl and mix until smooth.
2.	 Fill a pot with water and turn the heat to high. As 		
	
soon as the water starts to boil, add the noodles, 	 	
	
give them a gentle shake, and let them cook 	
	
	
for 3 minutes. Then drain the water and let the 	
	
	
noodles sit in the sink.
3.	 Add oil to a pan (24 cm/9.5 inches) and fry the ve-
getables with a pinch of salt for 3 minutes.
4.	 Push the vegetables to the side, add a bit more 	 	
	
oil, and add the beef. Try to separate the beef with 	
	
a spatula for maximum browning.
5.	 Add the seasonings and flip the meat. After 1 	
	
	
minute, give everything a good stir and add the 	 	
	
noodles.
6.	 Remove the pan from the heat, add the sauce, and 	
	
give everything a final stir. Done!
