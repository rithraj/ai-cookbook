250 g

D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Remove shirataki from the package and rinse it under 
cold water for 30 seconds until the entire liquid is  
washed away. Let the shirataki sit in the sink  
until the end of the recipe.
2.	 Chop up the onion and Pak choi.  
Peel and grate garlic and ginger. 
3.	 Place a pot (20cm/8inch) on a stove on medium heat. 
Add 2g of oil and start frying the onion and the pak choi 
for 3-4 minutes.
4.	 Switch the heat to medium-high and add the beef.  
Try to separate the beef with a spatula,  
so as much beef as possible gets in contact with the pan.  
Fry the beef for 2 minutes.
5.	 Add ginger and garlic with another touch  
of oil and keep frying for 20 seconds.
6.	 Add Gochujang and Miso paste. Stir everything and add 
the water. Now let the broth simmer for 5 minutes on 
medium-low heat.
7.	 Meanwhile, heat up a pan to medium-high without any 
oil. Add the shirataki noodles and dry fry them for 4-5 
minutes until the entire water is evaporated.
8.	 Transfer shirataki into the pot with the ramen and let it 
cook for one additional minute. Done!
N O T E S :
•	You can top the ramen with spring or/and pickled onions. 
Add a soft-boiled egg to enhance this dish even further.
•	Swap out shirataki for ramen noodles for the real deal.
