D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop all onions into bite-sized pieces. Add crushed tomatoes with salt, 
pepper, oregano, onion powder and garlic powder into a container.
2.	 Preheat a pan (28cm or 11 inch) to medium-high heat and add in oil. 
Start with frying ground beef. Spread it out with a spatula and wait 
for 2 minutes until the bottom has developed color. 
3.	 Add salt and pepper.
4.	 After 2-3 mins, add in onions and mix everything and keep frying 
for 2-3 minutes. The onions will become translucent.
5.	 Add in crushed tomatoes and combine everything.  
Keep cooking for another 2-3 minutes.
6.	 Add laughing cow wedges and incorporate them into the meat with 
a spatula by pressing them down. The sauce will slowly become 
orange and creamy.
7.	 Add mozzarella and mix until the cheese is fully melted. Place a big 
plate on a scale. Transfer the meat to that plate and remember the 
weight. Try to press the meat down, so it becomes flat. Put it into 
the fridge to cool down for 20 minutes. This will help prevent the 
burrito from becoming soggy.
8.	 Now place the meat plate on a scale. Take out 1 tortilla. Divide your 
remembered weight from before by 6. Take out this number from 
the meat plate and spread it on top of the tortilla. Try to cover the 
lower third  the tortilla and leave a bit of space around the edges.
9.	 Flip both sides left and right toward the middle of the tortilla. 
Now rolling from the bottom upward, make a burrito shape.  
Wrap it tight into aluminum foil. Done.
10.	Repeat with all tortillas. Add them into a ziplock back  
and freeze them for up to 3 months.
11.	The quickest way to defrost them is in a microwave. Remove them 
from the aluminum foil and place them on a plate. Microwave for 
260W or defrost setting for 7 minutes and then switch to 620W for 
another 3-4 minutes. Ready! 
N O T E S :
•	Feel free to add more spices like cumin,  
chili or paprika.
•	Can be made with ground turkey as well.
