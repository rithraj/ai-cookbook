D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Add cornmeal with water and broth powder into a pot and 
place it on a stove on high heat. As soon it starts to boil, reduce 
the heat to low, close the lid and let it simmer for 15 minutes.
2.	 Dice onion and carrot.
3.	 Cut chicken thigh into bite-size cubes, add oil on top and 
add a pinch of salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper and  
smoked paprika. Mix everything with your hands until the 
entire chicken turns red.
4.	 Heat a pan (24cm/9,5inch) to medium, add in oil and then 
onion and carrot. Fry this for 3-5 minutes under occasional 
stirring.
5.	 Switch up the heat to medium-high and add in chicken 
thighs. Spread it with a spatula, so as much meat as  
possible comes in contact with the pan. Let it fry for  
90 seconds and then flip it and fry again for 2 more  
minutes until the chicken is done.
6.	 As soon as the grits are done, add in the laughing low  
wedge. Cut the cmerican cheese slice into smaller  
pieces and add it in as well.
7.	 Stir the grits until the cheese is melted and  
the grits are creamy.
8.	 Add the grits to a plate, top it with the chicken  
and optional parsley. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 Don’t worry about overcooking chicken thighs.  
It’s very difficult to overcook thighs and get them tough.
