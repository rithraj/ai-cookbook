D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Peel and cut the apple into small chunks. 
2.	 Add the butter to a pot and melt on a medium heat.
3.	 Add the apple and fry until caramelized for 2-3 minutes.
4.	 Add the oats, water, sweetener and a pinch of salt.  
On medium heat, start to gently heat the oats  
on the stove.
5.	 Stir occasionally for 2 minutes until the oatmeal  
becomes thick. 
6.	 Mix the pudding powder and milk in a glass  
and stir well to prevent any lumps.
7.	 Add the pudding and milk to the pot of oatmeal and 
keep stirring for about 1 minute, or until the oatmeal 
becomes thick once again.
8.	 Remove from the heat and transfer everything to a bowl. 
9.	 Mix in Skyr and top with cinnamon. Serve and enjoy 
immediately or refrigerate overnight for overnight oats.
N O T E S :
•	Cover the surface with plastic wrap before  
refrigerating to prevent a skin from forming.

add in on top for more protein.
