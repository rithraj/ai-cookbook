D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 In a pot, add the oats, water, sweetener and a  
pinch of salt. On medium heat, start to  
gently heat the oats on a stove.
2.	 Stir occasionally for 2 minutes until the  
oatmeal becomes thick. 
3.	 Mix the pudding powder and milk in a glass  
and stir well to prevent any lumps.
4.	 Add the pudding and milk to the pot of oatmeal 
and keep stirring for about 1 minute, or until the 
oatmeal becomes thick once again.
5.	 Remove from the heat and transfer  
everything to a bowl. 
6.	 Mix in Skyr and top with blueberries. Eat right 
away or refrigerate overnight for overnight oats.
N O T E S :
•	Cover the surface with plastic wrap before  
refrigerating to prevent a skin from forming.  
The wrap needs to touch the oats.
•	Mix 15 g of vanilla Casein with 50 g water and  
add in on top for more protein.
