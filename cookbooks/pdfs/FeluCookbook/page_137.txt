ESTIMATED TIME: 45 MIN
FILLED SWEET
POTATO
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  2  S E R V I N G S :
1 	
	
sweet potato or 300 g
1 	
	
chicken breast or 180 g
1 	
	
medium onion or 50 g
1 	
	
red bell pepper or 150 g
50 g	
	
bbq dip or tzatziki
1 g 	
	
garlic powder
4 g 	
	
oil
Salt and black pepper
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Pierce the potato with a knife or fork and air fry it for 	 	
	
30-45 minutes at 200°C or 400°F. Alternatively, you can 	
	
use the oven.
2.	 Prepare either tzatziki or bbq dip, see recipes.
3.	 Chop the onion and the red bell pepper. Slice the chi-
cken breast into thin strips and season with salt, pepper, 
and garlic powder
4.	 Heat up a pan (24cm/9,5inch) to medium heat and add 
some oil. Add in onions and the bell pepper with a pinch 
of salt and let it fry for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
5.	 Make some space, add more oil and now the chicken 	 	
	
breast. Separate the chicken and fry each side for 1-2 	 	
	
minutes.
6.	 Once the potato is ready, cut it in half and fill it with the 
cooked chicken and vegetables. Finish by topping it with 
the chosen sauce. Done!
N O T E S :
1.	 Wait with frying the chicken until the sweet 
potato is almost done so you make sure that they 
both are ready at the same time.
2.	 You can also make both the sauces and dip the 	
	
chicken in both.
