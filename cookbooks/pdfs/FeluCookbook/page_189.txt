D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Place a bowl on a scale. Add flour, baking powder, 	
	
	
sweetener, and salt, then whisk. Melt the butter in the 		
	
microwave for 20 seconds. Add the Greek yogurt and 		
	
melted butter to the bowl, and combine everything 	
	
	
with your hands until you form a dough ball. Preheat 	 	
	
the oven to 180°C or 350°F.
2.	 Place another bowl on a scale. Add cream cheese, 	
	
	
cinnamon, brown sugar, and protein powder, then mix 		
	
until you get a creamy consistency.
3.	 Roll out the dough on a board until you get a flat, 	
	
	
rectangular shape. Add the filling on top and spread it 	
	
with a spoon until all the dough is covered.
4.	 Roll the dough upwards into a big cigar shape. Then, 	 	
	
cut it with a knife into 6-8 cinnamon rolls.
5.	 Place the cinnamon rolls into a baking dish lined with 	 	
	
parchment paper and bake them in the oven for 	
	
	
around 20 minutes.
6.	 Done! They don’t need frosting; just dunk them in milk. 	
	
They also last in the fridge for 3-4 days.
N O T E S :
•	
You can use oat flour instead all purpose.
•	
Add a bit of water if the batter is dry.  
That is because of the casein.
