D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Add oil to the chicken thighs and cover the entire 
chicken with salt, onion powder, chili powder, smo-
ked paprika, and garlic powder. Place the chicken in 
the oven for 12-15 minutes at 180°C or 350°F.
2.	 In a small glass, add avocado, cream cheese, hot 	 	
	
sauce, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder. Mix 	 	
	
with a fork until it becomes a mush.
3.	 Toast the bun in a pan with a bit of oil for 30-45 	 	
	
seconds until golden brown. 
4.	 Place the bun on a plate. Add half of the avocado 	
	
spread, then add the chicken that should be done 	
	
by now, followed by the mozzarella cheese, and 	 	
	
lastly, the other half of the avocado spread. 	
	
	
Top with the other half of the bun. Done! 
 
N O T E S :
•	Alternatively use the air fryer for the chicken thigh. 
•	You can also add lime juice instead of hot sauce to 		
	 the avo spread.
