onions with a pinch of salt and sauté them for 2-3 minutes.
6.	 Push the onions aside, add a bit more oil, and then add the 	
	
	
chicken breast. Season with some salt and pepper, and cook the 	
	
chicken breast for 1-2 minutes on each side.
7.	 Remove the pan from the heat and immediately pour in the

everything for 30 seconds.
