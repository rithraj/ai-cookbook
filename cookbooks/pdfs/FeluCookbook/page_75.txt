D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Peel and Cut the potatoes into thick slices, then into 
fries and then again into bite-size cubes. 2x2cm or 1x1 
inch.
2.	 Microwave the potatoes in a bowl for 5 min at 600W.
3.	 Chop the onion and bell pepper. Cut the chicken into 
thin strips. Prepare the mint sauce and store it in a 
squeeze bottle.
4.	 Heat a 24cm (9.5 inch) pan over medium-high heat. Fry 
the microwaved potatoes in a bit of oil with a pinch of 
salt for 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5.	 Push the potatoes to one side of the pan, add a bit more 
oil, then add the vegetables with another pinch of salt. 
Continue frying everything for an additional 2-3 minu-
tes.
6.	 Push everything to the side, add a bit more oil, and then 
add the chicken. Use a spatula to separate the chicken 
pieces for maximum browning.
7.	 Season with salt, black pepper, smoked paprika, and 
garlic powder. Let the chicken fry for one minute on one 
side before flipping and mixing everything in the pan. 
Allow the chicken to cook through for another minute, 
then remove the pan from the heat.
8.	 Transfer everything into a bowl. Add 20g of mint sauce 	
	
on top and mix well. Enjoy your meal!
