D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Add rice with water in a pot (18cm or 7inch diameter) 
with a pinch of salt. Place it on a stove on high heat.  
As soon the water starts to boil, reduce the heat to low, 
close the lid and let it simmer for 12-15 minutes.
2.	 Chop the bell pepper, onion, and carrot into bite-sized 	
	
pieces.
3.	 In a separate glass, combine hot sauce, honey, corn	
	
	
starch, and water and mix well.
4.	 In a pan on medium heat, add oil and begin frying the 	 	
	
chopped vegetables with a pinch of salt for 5-6 minutes, 	
	
stirring occasionally.
5.	 Push the vegetables to the side of the pan and add 	
	
	
more oil. Then, add the ground beef and separate 	
	
	
the meat with a spatula to ensure maximum browning.
6.	 After 1 minute, add salt, black pepper, cumin, and garlic 	
	
powder and mix everything together. Continue frying 	 	
	
for another minute until the beef is cooked through.
7.	 Next, add the sauce and laughing cow wedge to the 	
	
	
pan, stirring until the cheese is fully incorporated 	
	
	
(approximately 30-45 seconds).
8.	 Finally, add the cooked rice to the pan and mix 	
	
	
everything together. Your dish is ready!
