D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop up the peppers into very small pieces. 
2.	 Halve the tomato and grate them on a box grater into a 
puree. Throw away the skin. You don’t have to cook the  
tomatoes before grating. 
3.	 Crumble the feta cheese into small pieces.
4.	 Heat up a pan (18 cm or 7 inch) to a  
medium heat and add in the oil. 
5.	 Start with frying the peppers under occasional  
stirring for 3-4 minutes.
6.	 Add in the tomatoes, a pinch of salt, black  
pepper and chilli flakes. 
7.	 Keep simmering the tomatoes on medium heat  
for around 2 minutes.
8.	 Add the Feta cheese and keep stirring until the  
cheese has melted. This should take around a minute.
9.	 Crack in the eggs. Gently combine everything and  
keep cooking for 2 minutes until the eggs are set.  
Season with salt and pepper. Done!
