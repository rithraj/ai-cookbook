500 g

9 g

15 g

D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Place a big bowl in the fridge, so it starts to cool down.
2.	 Prepare aromatics. I highly recommend using lemongrass 
and ginger. Cut the lemongrass stem into 3 big pieces and 
peel the ginger.
3.	 Add water with dry gelatine into a small glass and mix  
with a spoon until combined. Set it aside.
4.	 Add the heavy cream and milk into a pot on medium heat, 
and also add the lemongrass and ginger. Let it slowly heat 
up until it simmers, around 6-8 minutes.
5.	 As soon it starts simmering, take it off the heat and let it 
rest for 10 minutes, so the aromatics release their flavor.
6.	 After 10 minutes, remove the lemongrass and ginger and 
add the gelatine to the pan of milk and cream.
7.	 Add a pinch of salt and whisk everything until gelatine is 
incorporated and dissolved, 20 seconds.
8.	 Take the bowl from the fridge and add in Skyr. Then add 
the mixed cream, milk, and gelatine mixture and start 
whisking everything until combined and smooth.
9.	 Keep the bowl on your counter for 5 more minutes under 
occasional stirring so the fat and water won’t separate.
10.	Distribute the Panna Cotta into 5 containers and  
refrigerate them for at least 2 hours until it is completely 
hard. Now you’re ready to serve!
N O T E S :
•	This can be stored in the fridge for 3-5 days.
•	Add toppings after refrigeration,  
such as peanut butter or microwaved fruit.
