HOMEMADE
ALMOND MILK
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
50 g 	
	
almonds
1000 g 		
water
2 g 	
	
Guar Gum
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Add the almonds to a bowl and fill it up  
with water until the almonds are covered.  
Refrigerate them for at least 12 hours.
2.	 After that, add softened almonds into a  
big blender with 1000 g of water.
3.	 Mix for 1 minute.
4.	 Now place cheesecloth over a bowl and  
strain the almond milk through the cloth.
5.	 Squeeze out the entire liquid until you end up  
with the leftover mixed almonds. 
6.	 Add the liquid back to the mixer with Guar Gum 
and mix again for 30 seconds. Done!
N O T E S :
•	Guar Gum is not mandatory. But it will help  
build an emulsion so the water and almondmilk  
don’t separate again.
•	The same can be made with cashews.
