washed away. Let the shirataki sit in the sink until  
the end of the recipe. 
2.	 Chop up carrots, celery and onions into  
roughly equal size pieces. 
3.	 Add oil to a pan (24cm/9.5inch) on medium-high heat. 
Add ground beef and fry on one side for 1 minute.
4.	 Add in the vegetables except for the garlic and mix 
everything and keep frying for another 3-4 minutes 
until the vegetables have some color.
5.	 Peel and grate in the garlic and fry for 20 seconds.  
Add in tomato puree and mix everything until beef  
and vegetables turn red.
6.	 Mix water with broth powder and gelatine  
in a separate glas.
7.	 Add broth into the pan, stir until combined and let it 
simmer for around 15-20 min on medium-low heat  
without a lid.
8.	 Dry fry shirataki in a nonstick pan until the water has 
evaporated. Add in bolognese to the shirataki and mix. 
Bolognese will be enough for two servings. Done!
