D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by chopping the onion and basil into bite-sized pieces. 	
	
Then, peel and grate the garlic, and grate the Parmesan 	
	
	
cheese as well.
2.	 Add oil to a pan and heat it over medium heat.
3.	 Add the onion to the pan and let it fry for about 3 minutes 
until it starts to caramelize.
4.	 Add the garlic and fry for 30 seconds, then add the tomato 
sauce with a pinch of salt and black pepper, and mix.
5.	 As soon as the sauce begins to simmer, crack in the 3 eggs, 
cover with a lid, and let the eggs cook for 2-3 minutes.
6.	 Remove the pan from the heat, sprinkle with Parmesan 
cheese, and then top with basil. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 Toast two slices of french baguette in a pan and lay them in 
a plate as the base to this dish before adding purgatorio on 
top.
•	 You can swap out some of the whole eggs for egg whites  
only to reduce calories further. I’d recommend 50 g egg  
whites for each whole egg removed.
