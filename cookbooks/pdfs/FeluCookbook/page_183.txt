D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by grinding the oats in a blender for  
60 seconds until it becomes oat flour.

6.	 Add all wet ingredients and banana into the second  
bowl and mix until combined.

or 3x9 inch). Transfer the batter to the baking sheet  
and bake for 35-45 min at 180°C or 350°F.

N O T E S :
•	
Leave out walnuts if you want to save some calories.
•	
Whey protein works better than Casein in this recipe. 
Casein doesnt rise properly.
•	
Add a bit of water if the batter is dry.
