FLUFFY 
PANCAKES
 Have you ever wondered how do you 
 make those fluffy pancakes that look 
 like clouds? Well here’s how to do it! 
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 On a medium- heat, preheat a non-stick pan.
2.	 Place a bowl on your scale. 
3.	 Now add all the dry ingredients and mix well.
4.	 Separate the egg in another bowl.  
Place the egg yolk in 1 bowl and the egg white in 
another. You need 3 bowls in total.
5.	 Next, add the buttermilk to a bowl with the  
egg yolk and mix.
6.	 Mix the egg whites with an electric hand mixer  
until it builds stiff peaks.
7.	 Now add the egg yolk to the dry ingredients  
and fold carefully. 
8.	 Then add the egg white and fold carefully.  
Don’t overmix the batter.
9.	 Place the pancake batter in the preheated pan.  
The batter will make 3-4 pancakes.
10.	Wait until it starts to form bubbles on top of the  
pancakes, appr. 1-2 minutes. Then flip all pancakes 
and let them cook once again for 1-2 minutes.
11.	 Remove from the pan and enjoy :)
N O T E S :
•	Don’t add Casein, or they won’t become fluffy.  
Separating eggs and whipping egg whites can  
be skipped but will result in less fluffy pancakes.
