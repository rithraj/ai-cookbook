perfect weeknight meal. 
ESTIMATED TIME: 20 MIN
LAHMACUN
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
100 g 	 	
ground beef 95/5
60 g 	
	
tomatoes
60 g	
	
bell peppers
2 	
	
cloves of garlic
½	
	
medium onion or 25 g
10 g 	
	
tomato puree
1
  g	
	
paprika  
1
  g	
	
cumin
1
  g	
	
cayenne pepper
Bunch 		
parsley
1 serving	
2 ingredient dough (see chapter)	
Salt and black pepper
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by preparing 1 serving of 2-ingredient dough (see recipe).
2.	 Prepare a blender or food processor.
3.	 Chop up the onion, pepper, and garlic, and blend them for 30 		
	
seconds.
4.	 Next, add the tomatoes and parsley into the food processor 	 	
	
and mix again for 30 seconds.
5.	 Then, add the beef, tomato puree, and all the seasonings. Mix 		
	
for 45-60 seconds until it turns into a paste.
6.	 Add oil into a non-stick pan (24cm/9.5inch). Don‘t turn on the 		
	
stove yet. Add in the dough ball and press it down and press 	 	
	
the edges slowly until it turns into a flat, round bread.
7.	 Now, add the ground beef filling on top of the dough. Spread 		
	
it around with a spoon. Turn on the heat to medium and 	
	
	
let it cook with a closed lid for 5-7 minutes.
8.	 As soon as the bottom has some color, you can either put the 		
	
pan for 2 minutes under the broiler in the oven or flip the 	
	
	
lahmacun and let it fry for another 2 minutes.
9.	 Remove the lahmacun and optionally add fresh vegetables with 	
	
a bit of lemon and roll it into a burrito shape. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 I use onions, romaine lettuce, tomatoes, and a squeeze of fresh 		
	 lemon as a filling before rolling it up.
