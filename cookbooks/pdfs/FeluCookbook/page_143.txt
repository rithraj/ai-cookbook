OVEN ROASTED CHICKEN THIGHS
& POTATOES
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
200 g 	 	
skinless,  
	
	
boneless chicken thighs
300 g 	 	
potatoes
1 	
	
medium onion or 50 g
1 	
	
carrot or 100 g
1 	
	
red bell pepper or 150 g
1 g 	
	
garlic powder 
1 g 	
	
dry rosemary 
1 g 	
	
oregano
6 g 	
	
oil
1 	
	
lemon
Salt and black pepper
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Preheat the oven to 220°C or 420°F. Peel and cut 		
	
the potatoes into cubes. Chop the onion, red 	
	
	
bell pepper, and carrot into bite-sized pieces. Cut 	
	
the chicken into large chunks.
2.	 Place a bowl on a scale and add the oil, all the 	
	
	
seasonings, and the juice of one lemon. Mix well. 	 	
	
Then add all the food and combine until 	 	
	
	
everything is coated with the marinade.
3.	 Place all the food into a baking dish and bake for 		
	
30-40 minutes, until done.
N O T E S :
•	You can use unpeeled potatoes if you prefer.
•	Don’t worry about overcooking chicken thighs; it’s 		
	 much harder to overcook them compared to 	
	
	 chicken breasts.
