D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Preheat the oven to 200°C or 400°F.
2.	 Clean potatoes with a brush under water. Don’t peel them. Cut 
them into halves. 1250g should be 3 medium-sized sweet potatoes.
3.	 Chop up onions, pepper and carrot into bite-size pieces.  
Add vegetables into a baking dish and add 10g of olive oil on top 
of them, a pinch of salt and black pepper.  
Mix everything with a spatula.
4.	 Add sweet potatoes and the baking dish with vegetables on a 
baking rack and bake them in the oven for 30 minutes.
5.	 Add Gochujang, water, soy and cornstarch into a container and 
mix everything until smooth.
6.	 Cut chicken breast into bite-size cubes and add a strong pinch 
of salt on top of them.
7.	 Heat up a big pan (28cm/11inch) to medium-high with 2g of oil. 
Add in a batch of chicken breast and fry them 1-2 minutes on 
each side until brown and cooked through. Remove them from 
the pan and repeat until all the chicken is cooked.
8.	 After 30 minutes of baking time, remove the vegetables and add 
them into the pan where you just fried the chicken on medium-
high heat. And fry them until the entire water is evaporated and 
the veggies are caramelized.
9.	 Add the chicken back to the pan and add the sauce and cook 
everything for 30 seconds until the sauce is sticky and thick.
10.	Distribute sweet potatoes in 5 meal prep containers.  
Do the same with the vegetables and the chicken. 
11.	Add canned corn evenly distributed in every  
container as well. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 It can be stored in the fridge for 3-5 days.
•	 Be careful not to overcook the chicken or it will  
become dry and tough. 2-3 minutes is generally enough.  
Don’t overcrowd the pan either.
