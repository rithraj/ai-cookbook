D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by chopping up the cabbage, zucchini, asparagus, and 
onion. Peel and grate the garlic.
2.	 Combine the stock powder with 50g of water and mix.
3.	 Add oil to a pan and heat it over medium heat. Begin by 	 	
	
frying the zucchini for 1-2 minutes with a small pinch of salt. 	
	
Then add the cabbage, onion, and asparagus with 	
	
	
another bit of oil and continue frying for 3 minutes, stirring 	
	
occasionally.
4.	 Now add the garlic, peas, cumin, and black pepper. Give 	 	
	
everything a stir and then pour in the chicken stock. 	
	
	
Immediately crack in 3 eggs and close the lid. Let it simmer 	
	
on medium-low heat for 3 minutes until the eggs are done.
5.	 Once the eggs are done, sprinkle crumbled feta cheese on 	
	
top. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 Add diced black olives and parsley as garnish.
•	 Toast two slices of french baguette in a pan and lay them in a 
plate as the base to this dish before adding shakshuka on top. 
•	 You can swap out some of the whole eggs for egg whites  
only to reduce calories further. I’d recommend 50 g egg  
whites for each whole egg removed.
