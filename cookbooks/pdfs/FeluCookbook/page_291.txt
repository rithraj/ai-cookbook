BEAN SAUCE 
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :  
200 g 	 	
shirataki
1 	
	
chicken breast or 180 g
1 	
	
medium onion or 50 g
2 g 	
	
oil
S A U C E :
25 g

 gochujang 
10 g 	
	
 rice vinegar
2 g

D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Remove shirataki from the package and rinse it 
under cold water for 30 seconds until the entire  
liquid is washed away. Let the shirataki sit in the 
sink until the end of the recipe.
2.	 Cut chicken breast into strips. 
3.	 Add all sauce ingredients in a glass and stir until 
smooth, 30 seconds.
4.	 Add oil into a pan (24cm/9.5inch) on medium-high 
heat. Add chicken, season with pepper and fry on  
1 side for 1 minute. Add in onions and stir every-
thing. Keep frying for another 1-1:30 minutes.  
Remove from the pan into a separate plate.
5.	 Add in the shirataki noodles, and dry fry them until 
the liquid has evaporated around 2 minutes.
6.	 Add the chicken back to the pan with the onions 
and mix.
7.	 Add in sauce and mix everything for 30 seconds. 
Add salt and pepper to taste. Done! 
N O T E S :
•	Add cornstarch slurry at the end to achieve  
a thicker sauce.
•	You can also fry vegetables like cabbage between 
frying chicken and adding shirataki for more  
volume. 150 g will be enough.
