CHOC & PB OATMEAL 
 I could eat this oatmeal 3 times
 per day, it is soooo good. 
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 In a pot, add the oats with a pinch of salt and dry 	
	
toast them on medium heat for 3 minutes.
2.	 Add milk and optional chia seeds, then let the 
oats simmer for 3-4 more minutes.
3.	 Meanwhile, add yogurt, peanut butter, and ca-
sein to a bowl.
4.	 Once the oats are ready, add cocoa powder to 
the pot and stir until it becomes a dark brown 
color. Remove from heat and transfer everything 
to the bowl.
5.	 Top with fruit or whipped cream. Done!
N O T E S :
•	This can be meal prepped, however it tastes best 
when still a bit warm.
