D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Preheat the oven to 180°C or 350°F. Trim the pork 	
	
and season it thoroughly with salt. Fry it in a 	
	
	
hot pan for 90 seconds on each side. 	
	
	
	
Then transfer it to a baking sheet and bake in the 	
	
oven for 14 minutes.
2.	 Meanwhile, peel and cut the potatoes into bite-	 	
	
sized cubes. Microwave them in a container for 5 		
	
minutes at 600W. Chop the onion and zucchini.
3.	 Add oil to a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on medium heat. 		
	
Add the microwaved potatoes with a pinch of salt 	
	
and fry them for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4.	 Then add another bit of oil and add the vegetables 	
	
with a pinch of salt, black pepper, garlic powder, 	 	
	
and onion powder. Keep frying everything for 	
	
	
another 3-4 minutes.
5.	 Remove the meat from the oven and let it rest for 	
	
3-4 minutes. Meanwhile, combine soy sauce, 	
	
	
balsamic vinegar, honey, and cornstarch in a 	
	
	
glass. Add it to the pan and mix until it thickens, 	 	
	
about 30 seconds.
6.	 Slice the meat into thick slices, top with the 	
	
	
vegetables, and it‘s done!
