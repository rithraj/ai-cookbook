N O T E S :
•	
Whey/Casein blend would work best in this recipe.
•	
Cottage cheese can be replaced with the same amount  
Skyr or Greek yogurt.
•	
You can substitute lemon with same amount   
orange for a different flavor.
•	
Add a bit of water if the batter is dry.  
That is because of the casein.
