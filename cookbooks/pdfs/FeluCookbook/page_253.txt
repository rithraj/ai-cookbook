D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by slicing the chicken breast into strips, then 
into bite-sized pieces. Place the chicken in a bowl, 
add 20g of olive oil and all the seasonings, and mix 
well.
2.	 Chop the onions and bell peppers and set them 	 	
	
aside in a separate bowl.
3.	 In another bowl, combine the avocados, Greek 	
	
	
yogurt, chopped mint, juice of 2 limes, salt, and 	
	
	
garlic powder. Mash with a fork until you have 	
	
	
a dip.
4.	 Stir-fry the chicken in a pan over medium-high 	
	
	
heat for 1 minute on each side, then transfer it to 	 	
	
a bowl. Cook the chicken in two batches so 	
	
	
you don’t overcrowd the pan.
5.	 Next, stir-fry the onions and bell peppers and 
transfer them to the bowl with the cooked chicken. 
Give everything a good stir.
6.	 Lay out the tortillas and sprinkle 20g of shredded 		
	
mozzarella on each one. Add a spoonful of 	
	
	
the avocado dip and a ladleful of the chicken 	
	
	
mixture. Fold the tortillas to form quesadillas. 	
	
	
Repeat until you have 12 quesadillas.
7.	 Add a little oil to a pan over medium heat and cook 	
	
each quesadilla for about 1 minute on each side, 	 	
	
until golden brown.
8.	 To store, wrap each quesadilla in parchment paper 
and then place them in a zip-lock bag. They can be 
frozen for up to 3 months or refrigerated for up to 
5 days.
