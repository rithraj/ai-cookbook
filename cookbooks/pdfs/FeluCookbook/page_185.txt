D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by grinding the oats in a blender for  
around 60 seconds until it becomes oat flour.
2.	 Place a bowl on a scale.
3.	 Add all dry ingredients to the bowl.  
Whisk everything for around 10-15 secs.
4.	 Place a second bowl on the scale.
5.	 Gently smash the banana in the second  
bowl with a fork until it becomes mush.  
Add the juice of the orange to the banana and mix.
6.	 Add all wet ingredients into the second bowl  
and mix well until combined.
7.	 Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients  
and slowly whisk until nice and smooth.  
Add a small splash of water if it sticks.
8.	 Place parchment paper onto a baking sheet  
(12x18cm or 5x7inch).
9.	 Transfer the batter to the baking sheet and  
bake for 30-35 min at 180°C or 350°F.
10.	After baking, remove the cake from the  
baking sheet and let it cool down for 30 min.
11.	 Slice and enjoy. The banana bread lasts in  
the fridge for 2-3 days.
N O T E S :
•	
Whey/Casein blend would work best in this recipe.
•	
Add a bit of water if the batter is dry.  
That is because of the casein.
