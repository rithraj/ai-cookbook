COLD MEAT
PLATE
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
2 	
	
wheat tortilla (20cm or 8inch)
125 g 	 	
fresh mozzarella light
100 g 	 	
tomatoes
100 g 	 	
deli meat
4 g 	
	
olive oil
0.5 g 	
	
oregano
Salt and black pepper
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Cut the Mozzarella and the tomatoes  
into equal thick slices.
2.	 Place the deli on a plate, then the mozzarella and 
the tomatoes.
3.	 Add oregano, pepper and salt on top.
4.	 Add olive oil over the entire plate.
5.	 heat up tortillas in a dry pan for 1 minute each side 	
	
and serve with the meat plate. Done!
N O T E S :
•	You can add more cold meat if you want, I usually go 
with turkey or chicken.
•	You need fresh Mozzarella for this recipe.  
The low-moisture shredded Mozzarella will  
not work.
•	I use protein tortillas for this recipe but regular 	
	
	 wheat tortillas will work just as fine.
