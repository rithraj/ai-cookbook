400 g 	 	
crushed tomatoes
1 	
	
medium onion or 50 g

D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop up onions and paprika into bite-size pieces.  
Peel and grate garlic. Drain the kidney beans. 
2.	 Add water with broth powder and gelatine  
into a glass and mix until combined.
3.	 Add oil to a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on medium heat and  
fry the onions and pepper for 4-5 minutes until they 
start caramelizing.
4.	 Add the ground beef and fry on medium-high heat for  
additional 3-4 minutes until the beef starts to get color.
5.	 Add in garlic, and keep frying. 
6.	 Now add in crushed tomatoes and broth,  
	
and stir until smooth. 
7.	 Next add salt, pepper, cumin, chili, and cocoa  
powder. Mix everything, close the lid and let it  
simmer on medium heat for 15 minutes.
8.	 Remove the lid and if the chili is not thick enough,  
let it simmer for another 5 minutes, so more liquid is 
evaporated. Done!
N O T E S :
•	Chili is amazing for meal prepping. It lasts for 3-4 days.  
Adjust the recipe to make more servings by multiplying by 2.
•	Chili can become a gel when cooled down because of 
the gelatin. It will dissolve immediately as soon as it gets 
reheated, so don‘t worry.
