D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop all vegetables into bite-sized pieces.
2.	 Add all sauce ingredients to a small glass and mix  
until combined. Prepare a slurry with 50 g water and  
2 g cornstarch, mix to prevent clumps.
3.	 Add 2g of oil into a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on  
medium-high heat and fry the ground beef for  
2 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
4.	 Remove the beef from the pan and add mushrooms  
with 50 g of water. Let it saute until the mushrooms  
collapse, 4-5 minutes. Add rest of oil and keep frying 
until mushrooms get color, around 4-5 minutes.
5.	 Meanwhile, fill up a pot with water and set it on a stove 
on medium-high heat. Don’t add the noodles yet.
6.	 Add all remaining vegetables into the pan with  
mushrooms and keep frying for 2-3 minutes.
7.	 Add udon noodles with a pinch of salt into boiling water. 
The noodles need 3 minutes.
8.	 As soon noodles are ready, transfer them into the pan 
with the ground beef. Add in the sauce with a bit of  
the slurry and mix until combined and the sauce is thick.  
Done!
N O T E S :
•	 The sauce can be changed as long as you stick to East Asian 
flavors. Try to experiment with Mirin or Gochujang.
•	 Recipe is great with chicken breast instead of beef or pak 	 	
	 choi instead of carrots.
