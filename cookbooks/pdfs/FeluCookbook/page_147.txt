D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Flatten the chicken breast evenly with something heavy 
and optional dry brine it as described in the chapter 
“How to cook chicken breast”.
2.	 Dice the onion. Peel and grate garlic.  
Chop up tomatoes. Cut mozzarella into strips.
3.	 Heat up a pan (24cm/9,5inch) to medium-high heat and 
add in 2g of oil. Add in the chicken breast. Fry it for 2-3 
minutes on each side until almost cooked through. 
4.	 Remove the chicken. Add another touch of oil, switch 
the heat to medium and add in the onion.  
Fry them for 3 minutes until they start to caramelize.
5.	 Add in the garlic. Keep frying for 20 seconds.
6.	 Add in water and tomatoes. Season with salt, pepper 
and oregano. Mix everything, close the lid and let it  
simmer for 5-6 minutes until the tomatoes release  
their juices, and the sauce thickens up.
7.	 Add the chicken back, top the chicken with Mozzarella 
cheese, and close the lid again. Keep it simmering for 
30-45 seconds until Mozzarella is melted and the  
chicken is heated up again. Top with fresh basil. Done!
N O T E S :
•	This taste amazing with rice or potatoes.
•	It can also be made with shredded Mozzarella 
instead  fresh.
