D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Fill a bowl with lukewarm water and add in lasagna sheets.  
If you skip this step and add lasagna raw into the oven,  
they will soak up the sauce and make the lasagna dry.
2.	 Chop all vegetables and mushrooms into bite-sized pieces.  
Peel and grate garlic.
3.	 Add broth and dry gelatine into a glass and stir until smooth.
4.	 Add mushrooms with 50g of water into a pan (28cm or 11 inch) 
on medium-high heat. Let it saute until the mushrooms  
collapse. Add 2g  oil and keep frying until mushrooms  
get color, around 4-5 minutes.
5.	 Make space in the pan and add 2g of oil.  
Add the beef. Add a pinch of salt and black pepper.  
Fry the beef for 2-3 minutes until the meat gets color.
6.	 Add vegetables and fry everything under occasional  
stirring for 7-8 minutes. Add garlic and fry for 20 seconds.
7.	 Add crushed tomatoes and broth. Let everything simmer on 
medium heat for 5-7 more minutes. 
8.	 Preheat oven on 180°C or 350°F.
9.	 Take a baking sheet that has space for 2 lasagna sheets beside each 
other. First, add a bit of sauce. Then add 2 lasagna sheets to cover 
the sauce. Now add 1 thick layer of sauce. Add 100 g of cottage 
cheese on top. Repeat 1 more time. Bake this dish for 20 minutes.
10.	Remove the lasagna, add Mozzarella on top, and back to the 
oven for 3-4 minutes until the cheese has melted.
11.	Remove the lasagna, let it rest for 5-10 minutes until everything 
is set. Cut it into four servings and store them in the fridge or 
eat them immediately.
N O T E S :
•	 Lasagna lasts in the fridge for 3-4 days.  
Microwave for 3-5 minutes before you want to eat.
