DELI SUB 
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by cutting the baguette in half and scooping 	
	
out the soft part of the bread to save about half 	 	
	
the calories.
2.	 Next, prepare the spicy mayo. Chop the lettuce, 
tomatoes, pickles, and mozzarella.
3.	 Lay one half of the baguette on a piece of 	
	
	
parchment paper and spread the mayo over it 	
	
	
as the base. 	Add your choice of deli meat, 	
	
	
followed by the mozzarella. Next, layer the 	
	
	
chopped vegetables, sprinkle a bit of salt for taste, 	
	
and then place the other half of the baguette on 		
	
top.
4.	 Roll the entire sandwich in the parchment paper, 		
	
done!
N O T E S :
•	The soft part of the bread can be baked in the oven 	
	 to make croutons, or you can place it in a zip-lock 		
	 bag and use it to feed the birds outside your house.
•	Try different meat combinations, most of them work 	
	 great.
