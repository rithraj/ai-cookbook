D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Crack the eggs into a bowl and add a strong  
pinch of salt and black pepper.  
Mix with a fork and set it aside.
2.	 Cut up the tomatoes and Mozzarella into  
thin slices. Chop up the basil. 
3.	 Add the oil to a pan on medium heat.  
Add eggs, and slowly push the edges of the  
eggs towards the middle of the pan and tilt  
the pan so the uncooked egg goes underneath. 
4.	 Do this for about a minute, the middle of the  
mixture should still be slightly raw. You should have 
a big egg pancake. Add the mozzarella on one-
half of the eggs and close the lid. Let it cook for 
about a minute so the cheese melts faster.
5.	 Remove the lid, add in tomatoes and fresh basil. 
Flip the side without cheese over the other side  
to form an omelette. Done!
N O T E S :
•	Be careful to not overcook the eggs. 
•	The entire process takes about 3 minutes. 
•	Do it on medium heat and not higher than  
that or risk burning rather than cooking.
