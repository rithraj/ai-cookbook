D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	
Start by cleaning and washing the potatoes,  
I don’t peel them, but you can if you don’t like the skin. 
2.	 Cut the potatoes into thick slices, then into fries and then 
again into bite-size cubes. 2x2cm or 1x1 inch.
3.	 Microwave the potatoes in a bowl for 5 min at 600W.
4.	 Dice the onion and cut the deli meat into cubes.
5.	 Place a pan on the stove on medium-high heat.  
Add 5g of oil into a pan and add in the potatoes. 
6.	 Fry them for around 3-4 minutes under occasional  
stirring until they have some color.
7.	
Add the onions and deli meat with another spray of oil. Keep 
frying under occasional stirring for a further 3-4 minutes.
8.	 Make three holes in the potato mixture to make space for 
the eggs. Add a bit of oil into every hole, and then switch 
the heat to medium and crack in the eggs.
9.	 Add pepper, and chilli powder over everything. 
10.	 Add soy sauce around the edges (not on top  the eggs)  
and immediately close the lid to trap the steam.  
Cook until the eggs are done, 2-3 more minutes. 
Top with parsley or cilantro. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 Add more spices to make this dish more interesting with 
flavors like cumin, turmeric or cayenne pepper.
•	 Add additional egg whites for more protein.
