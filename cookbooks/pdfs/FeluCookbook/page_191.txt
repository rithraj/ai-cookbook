D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Strain the can of chickpeas to separate them from the  
liquid. But make sure to save the liquid in a separate bowl.
2.	 Dry roast the chickpeas in a pan on medium-high heat 
for 1-2 minutes or until they turn golden brown. 
3.	 Add coconut oil and keep frying for 1 min.  
Remove from the heat.
4.	 Add the chickpeas and milk into a food processor or 
blender and mix for 2 minutes until smooth.
5.	 Add all ingredients except the flour and mix again for 1 min.
6.	 Add the flour and mix until smooth. If it is too dry,  
add 50g  water and keep mixing.  
It should have a creamy and smooth consistency.
7.	 Place parchment paper onto a baking sheet (20x20cm 
or 8x8inch) and transfer the batter to the tray. Spread 
everything out evenly using a spatula. Sprinkle over the 
chocolate chips and bake for 30 min at 180°C or 350°F.
8.	 After baking let it cool down for 15 min and cut it into 
equal sized bars. Bars last in the fridge for 2-3 days.
  
N O T E S :
•	
Whey/Casein blend would work as well. Although please 
note that whey can sometimes be a little dry.
•	
Powdered peanuts can be replaced with  
40g of peanut butter.
•	
To make this recipe vegan, replace casein with  
soy protein and milk with almond milk.
•	
You can add an optional 30g of sweetener for additional 
sweetness.
