CHEESY CHICKEN 
BURRITO
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Slice chicken into thin strips, then place them in a bowl. 	
	
Add oil, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, 		
	
paprika, and a pinch of salt and black pepper. Mix with 		
	
tongs until everything is evenly coated.
2.	 In another bowl, combine cheddar cheese, cornstarch, 		
	
evaporated milk, and hot sauce. Mix well.
3.	 Heat oil in a 24 cm (9.5 inch) pan over medium-high 	
	
	
heat. Add the chicken and fry for 2 minutes, flipping it 		
	
after 1 minute, until the chicken is cooked through 	
	
	
and has a nice color. Then remove the pan from 	
	
	
the heat.
4.	 Pour the cheese sauce into the pan with the chicken and 	
	
mix until it turns into a creamy and gooey texture.
5.	 Transfer the mixture to a tortilla and roll it into a burrito 	
shape. Place the burrito back in the pan and toast on all 	
4 sides for 30 seconds each. Done!
N O T E S :
•	This recipe can also be prepared for meal prep. Simply 	 	
	 multiply the ingredients by 2 or more. Allow the chicken 		
	 to cool down completely before rolling it into the 	
	
	 tortilla, as steam can make the burrito soggy in the fridge.
