PATTY MELT 
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Form a burger patty with the ground beef and dice the 	
	
onion.
2.	 Heat oil in a 24 cm (9.5-inch) pan over medium-high 	
	
	
heat. Add the sandwich bread and toast on one 	
	
	
side, then remove it and place a cheese slice on top 	
	
	
of the toasted side.
3.	 Add more oil to the pan and fry the patty for 1–2 	
	
	
minutes on each side. Season with salt and black pepper. 
4.	 Once the burger is cooked, place it on top of the 	
	
	
sandwich bread with cheese. 
5.	 Add oil to the pan, then add the diced onions with a 	
	
	
pinch of salt and a splash of water. Stir occasionally over 	
	
medium heat until the water has evaporated. Repeat by 	
	
adding another splash of water and cook until 		
	
	
evaporated, repeating this process three more times.
6.	 Place the cooked onions on top of the burger patty. 	
	
	
Close the sandwich and add it back to the pan, toasting 	
	
the remaining sides until golden brown. Done!
