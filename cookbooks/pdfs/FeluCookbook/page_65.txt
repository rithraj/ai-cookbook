D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by combining flour, baking powder, and salt in a 
bowl. Then add skyr and mix everything with your hands 
until you form a dough ball. You will likely need to knead 
the dough for 2 minutes. Then set it aside
2.	 Cut 3 cheese sticks into 2 cm or 1-inch pieces. 		
	
	
Finely chop the 4th cheese stick.
3.	 Take a baking sheet, spray some oil on it, and 	 	
	
	
spread the oil with your hands. Place the dough 	
	
	
ball on the sheet and slowly press it down to form 	
	
	
a round pizza shape.
4.	 Lay the larger cheese stick pieces around the 	 	
	
	
edges, leaving a bit of space between them. Roll 	
	
	
the edges of the dough towards the center over 	
	
	
the cheese sticks to form a stuffed crust.
5.	 Add tomato sauce to the middle of the dough, and 	
	
	
season with salt, black pepper, and oregano. 	
	
	
	
Then add the finely chopped 4th cheese stick and 	
	
	
the shredded mozzarella.
6.	 Bake in the oven at 220°C or 420°F for 15-20 	 	
	
	
minutes. Done!

onions or a vegetabrian pizza for more volume!
