D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Add pasta to a pot filled with water and a small pinch of salt. 
Place the pot on the stove, set to high heat. As soon as it starts 
to boil, reduce the heat to medium-high and let it simmer until 
the pasta is al dente, typically about 12 minutes.
2.	 While the pasta is cooking, cut the chicken into thin 		
	
	
strips and place them in a bowl. Add oil, onion powder, 	
	
	
garlic powder, cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, black pepper	
	
and mix the chicken evenly. 
3.	 Mix the 3 ingredints cheese sauce in a small bowl.
4.	 Put a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on the stove on medium-high 	
	
	
heat and fry the chicken for 60-90 seconds on each side 	
	
	
just until they turn brown in color.
5.	 Turn off the heat. Add the previously prepared cheese 	
	
	
sauce to the chicken in the pan, mixing it in for about 30 	
	
	
seconds until you achieve a creamy consistency.
6.	 Once the pasta is cooked, reserve some of the pasta 	
	
	
water and then drain the rest. Add the drained pasta to 	
	
	
the pan with chicken and sauce, combining everything 	
	
	
thoroughly. If the sauce appears too thick, add a little 	
	
	
evaporated milk or some of the reserved pasta water to 	
	
	
adjust.
N O T E S :
•	 You can add onions and red bell peppers to increase the 	
	
volume. Fry them in the pan for 3-5 minutes before adding 
the chicken.
