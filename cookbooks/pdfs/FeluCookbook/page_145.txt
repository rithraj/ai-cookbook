turn it and cut it into bite-size cubes.
4.	 Add oil to a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on medium heat. 
Add the onion and vegetables and fry  
them under occasional stirring for  
3-4 minutes until soft and caramelized.
5.	 Push the veggies to the side of the pan.  
Add a spray of oil and add in the chicken.  
Try to separate the chicken cubes with a spatula,

garlic powder and black pepper. Fry the chicken for 
2-3 minutes under occasional stirring until done.

tortilla with 20 g shredded mozzarella and form a
