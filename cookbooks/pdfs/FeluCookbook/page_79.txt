D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by adding rice and 125g of water to a pot  
with a pinch of salt.
2.	 Put the stove on high heat, and as soon as the water 
starts to boil, turn the heat down to low,  
close the lid and let it simmer for 12-15 min.
3.	 In the meantime, chop up all the vegetables  
into equal bite-sized pieces.
4.	 Cut chicken breast into strips.
5.	 Add all sauce ingredients to a glass and mix  
until combined, this should take 20 seconds.
6.	 Put a pan (28cm or 11 inch) on the stove on medium heat 
and add in 6g of oil. Add in all the vegetables, salt and 
pepper and fry them for 7-8 min until caramelized.
7.	 Push the veggies to the side to make space for  
the chicken. Add in 2g of oil and fry the chicken  
on both sides for 60-90 seconds until done.
8.	 Add rice as a layer in a bowl. The chicken goes into the 
middle on top of the rice and the vegetables around  
the chicken. Drizzle the sauce on everything. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 Vegetables can be swapped out for anything you like.  
Pickled veggies are amazing in combination with the sauce.
•	If you have a smaller pan, first fry the chicken, remove it 
and fry the veggies and at the end, add in the chicken  
just to reheat it.
