D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Rinse the rice under cold water to remove excess starch. 
Add rice with 125g of water and a pinch of salt into a pot.
2.	 Put the pot on a stove on high heat. As soon the water 
starts to boil, reduce the heat to low, close the lid and  
let it simmer for 12-15 minutes.
3.	 Chop the jalapeños, bell pepper, and onion. Peel and grate 
the garlic and ginger. In a glass, mix together soy sauce and 
hoisin sauce.
4.	 Add 2g of oil to a pan over medium heat. Add the onion 
and bell pepper with a pinch of salt, frying the vegetables 
for 3 minutes while occasionally stirring.
5.	 Push the vegetables to one side of the pan, add a bit more 	
	
oil, and then add the beef. Try to separate it with a spatula 	
	
and let it fry for 1 minute.
6.	 Add chili powder, paprika, jalapeños, garlic, ginger, and 
peas. Stir everything together and continue frying for anot-
her minute.
7.	 Now, add in the cooked rice and the sauce. Stir until all the 	
	
rice is evenly coated with the sauce. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 After cooking, let the rice sit in the hot pot to remove all  
the liquid. This will help make the rice less clumpy.
•	 If you have left over rice the recipe works even better.
•	 You can also use 125g instant rice for this recipe.
