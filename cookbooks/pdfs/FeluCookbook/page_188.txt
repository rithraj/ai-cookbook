D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Grind the oats in a blender for 60 seconds  
or until it becomes oat flour.
2.	 Place a bowl on a scale.
3.	 Add all dry ingredients to the bowl. 
4.	 Whisk everything for 10-15 secs.
5.	 Place a second bowl on the scale.
6.	 Add all wet ingredients to the second bowl  
and mix until combined.
7.	 Add the wet to the dry ingredients and slowly whisk 
until smooth. Add a small splash of water if it sticks.
8.	 Transfer the batter to a donut tray and bake for  
12-15 min at 180°C or 350°F.
9.	 Prepare a frosting of your choice.  
My favorite is Nootella (see recipe).
10.	Top your freshly baked donuts with the frosting  
and enjoy.
N O T E S :
•	
Whey/Casein blend works best in this recipe.
•	
Oat flour can be replaced with all purpose flour.
•	
Another frosting: In a bowl add 50 g strawberries,  
10 g sweetener and microwave for 30-60 seconds on  
medium. Then add 100 g of greek yogurt and mix.  
Dump the donuts in frosting and top with  
shredded coconut.
•	
Add a bit of water if the batter is dry.  
That is because of the casein.
