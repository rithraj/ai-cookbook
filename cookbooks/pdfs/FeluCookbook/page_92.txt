CHEESY BEEF 
BURRITO
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Place a blender on the scale and add cottage cheese, 	 	
	
evaporated milk, cheddar cheese, gochujang, garlic 	
	
	
powder, onion powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, and a 	
	
pinch of salt and black pepper. Blend for 60 seconds.
2.	 Next, chop up the onion.
3.	 Then, add oil to a 24 cm (9.5 inch) pan over medium-
high heat. Add the onion and fry for 3 minutes, then add 
the ground beef. Continue frying both for another 1-2 
minutes, stirring occasionally, until the beef gets some 
color. Add a pinch of salt and black pepper.
4.	 Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the cheese 	 	
	
sauce for about 1 minute until it becomes creamy.
5.	 Transfer the mixture to a tortilla and roll it into a burrito 	
	
shape. Place the burrito back in the pan and toast on all 	
	
4 sides for 30 seconds each. Done!
N O T E S :
•	This recipe can also be prepared for meal prep. Simply 	 	
	 multiply the ingredients by 2 or more. Allow the beef to 		
	 cool down completely before rolling it into the tortilla, as 	
	 steam can make the burrito soggy in the fridge.
