D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop the onion, and in a glass, combine soy sauce, gochu-
jang, and honey; mix well.
2.	 Heat a pan over medium heat, add some oil, and fry the 
onions with a pinch of salt for 2-3 minutes. 
3.	 Then, add more oil and the turkey. Spread the meat out 
with a spatula. Season with cumin, garlic powder, and black 
pepper. After 1 minute, flip the meat and cook for another 
minute until it‘s cooked through.
4.	 Pour in the sauce and stir to combine everything. Follow 
with the egg and egg whites, stirring continuously for 45-60 
seconds.
5.	 Remove the pan from the heat, and add everything to a 	 	
	
tortilla. Roll it into a burrito, then return it to the pan 	
	
	
to toast all sides until crisp and lightly browned. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 You can also add 2 whole eggs instead of 1 whole egg and one 
egg white. It will have 50 more calories due to the 5g of fat.
•	 Recipe can be easy turned into a meal prep recipe. Just 	
	
	 multiply ingredients by the number of tortilla and store the 	 	
	 tortillas in a zip log bag and then in the freezer.
