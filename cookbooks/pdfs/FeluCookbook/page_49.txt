D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop up vegetables into small pieces.
2.	 Place an oven-safe bowl on a scale.
3.	 Add the oats and baking powder and stir  
until combined.
4.	 Add in the tomatoes, spinach, onion, eggs,  
egg whites, water and broth powder.
5.	 Add seasoning. I like to add garlic powder and cayenne 
pepper. If you have low-sodium broth, then add salt.
6.	 Whisk everything for 30 seconds or until combined.
7.	 Bake this in a preheated oven for 25-30 min  
at 180°C or 350°F.
8.	 Prepare the Mozzarella cheese. 
9.	 Put the Mozzarella on top  the baked oats for  
the last 1-2 minutes until fully melted. Done!
N O T E S :
•	Feel free to add a different kind of spice each  
time you make this dish. Cumin, turmeric work great.
