I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
1 	
	
brioche bun (200 Calories)
140 g 	 	
skinless,  
	
	
boneless chicken thighs
1 	
	
slice american cheese
15 g 	
	
light mayo
10 g 	
	
sriracha
5 g 	
	
honey
5 g 	
	
flour
1	
	
egg
15 g 	
	
panko breadcrumbs
1 g 	
	
garlic powder
1 g 	
	
cayenne pepper
2 g 	
	
oil
Salt and black pepper
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Prepare three plates. Fill the first plate with flour.
Crack the egg into the second plate and whisk it. In 
the third plate, mix the panko breadcrumbs with ca-
yenne pepper, salt, black pepper, and garlic powder.
2.	 Coat the chicken thigh in flour, dip it into the 	
	
	
whisked egg, and then cover it with the panko 	
	
	
mixture.
3.	 Air fry the breaded chicken thigh at 200°C (400°F) 	
	
for 12 minutes. Alternatively, you can bake it in the 	
	
oven.
4.	 In a small bowl, combine the sriracha, honey, and 		
	
light mayonnaise.
5.	 Add a little oil to a pan over medium heat and 	
	
	
toast the inside of the bun until golden brown, 	
	
	
about 2 minutes.
6.	 For the last 30 seconds of air-frying, place a slice 		
	
of American cheese on top of the chicken so it can 	
	
melt.
7.	 Spread the sauce on the bun, top it with the 	
	
	
chicken, and you’re done! 
N O T E S :
•	If you don’t have panko, regular breadcrumbs will 
work.
•	You can also use a chicken breast instead of chicken 	
	 thighs.
