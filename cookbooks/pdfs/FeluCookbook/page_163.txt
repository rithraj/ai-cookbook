Mix everything with a spoon until the chicken is coated.
2.	 Dice onions, peel and grate garlic.
3.	 Add 2g of oil to a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on high heat. Wait until 
the pan is hot, then add chicken and fry one side for 1 minute. 
Flip the chicken and fry the other side for another minute until 
both sides have color. Remove the chicken from the pan.
4.	 Add 2g of oil to the pan, switch heat to medium, add the onions 
and fry them for 3 minutes under occasional stirring until brown.
5.	 Add 2g garam Masala, garlic powder, paprika, turmeric, ca-
yenne pepper and black pepper. Mix everything and keep 
toasting them for 30 seconds. 
6.	 Make some space in the pan and add the grated garlic.  
Fry the garlic for 20 seconds until fragrant.
7.	 Add crushed tomatoes with a splash of water and mix everyt-
hing. Let this simmer for 5-6 minutes.
8.	 Now add evaporated milk and Laughing Cow cheese.  
Mix it by pressing the laughing cow down, so everything  
gets incorporated. Add the chicken back to the pan and let 
everything simmer for 5-7 minutes until the chicken is cooked 
through. Done!

•	 Chicken thighs are hard to overcook, so don’t worry  
if you let it simmer a bit longer to be safe.
•	 You can marinate the chicken after seasoning  
for 1-4 hours in the fridge.
