SMASHED
CHEESEBURGER
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
1 	
	
brioche bun (200 calories)
180 g 	 	
ground beef 95/5
1 	
	
slice american cheese
1 	
	
medium onion or 50 g
2 	
	
pieces  parchment paper - 
	
	
15x15cm or 6x6inch
2 g 	
	
oil
Salt and black pepper
S A U C E :
20 g 	
	
ketchup
20 g 	
	
Greek yogurt
20 g 	
	
pickled cucumber 
10 g 	
	
pickle water
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Chop up the onion into small pieces.  
Mix all the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl.
2.	 Form 2 balls out of the beef. 90 g each. Salt and pepper both.
3.	 In a big pan, cast iron works best, add 2 g of oil on medium-
high heat. Start with frying the onions for 1-2 minutes.
4.	 Now heat up the pan to high and add both beef balls.  
Place 1 parchment paper over each beef ball. Take a  
spatula and something heavy like a glass bottle and press 
both patties down. The parchment paper will prevent the 
beef from sticking to the spatula. You can press the patty 
down with the spatula only, but something heavy will help 
on top of the spatula.
5.	 Fry 1 side of the beef for 30-45 seconds, and flip the beef by 
scraping the bottom of the patty. If it sticks, you’ve done it right! 
6.	 Place a slice of american cheese on top of 1 patty after flipping. 
7.	 Add a little splash of water to the side of the pan and close 
the lid. The steam will help melt the cheese.
8.	 Add both sides of the bun to the pan and toast  
them for 15 seconds.
9.	 Assemble burger. With the first bun, add sauce, then patties, 
then the onion, then again sauce and top the bun. Done!
N O T E S :
•	 A cast iron pan will work best and will develop a  
nice crust on the patty. 
•	 You can also swap out Greek yogurt in the sauce  
for light Mayo. It will be 50 calories more but will be tastier.
