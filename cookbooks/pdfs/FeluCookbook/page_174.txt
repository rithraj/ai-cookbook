D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by placing a bowl on a scale.
2.	 Add all dry ingredients and mix well.
3.	 Next add peanut butter.  
Alternatively you can add 60g of powdered peanuts.
4.	 Now you can add the milk and combine everything 
with a spatula. After 30-60 seconds it should have a 
thick creamy consistency. If too dry, feel free to add 
30 g of water and keep stiring.
5.	 Place parchment paper onto a baking tray  
(8 x 22cm or 3x 9 inch).
6.	 Transfer everything onto the baking sheet.
7.	 Now bake at 180°C or 350°F for 20-25 min.
8.	 After baking, remove the oatbar and place it on  
a plate to cool for around 20 minutes.
9.	 Finally, cut into 6 equal sized bars.  
They will last in the fridge for about 2-3 days. 
N O T E S :
•	
Casein protein powder works best for this recipe.  
If you add whey protein you might have to use less 
water. Also with whey it can be a bit dry so I would 
also advise adding in a banana.
•	
You can add 25 g of sweetener if the  
protein powder you want to use isn’t sweet enough.
