CHICKEN & POTATO
STIR FRY
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Dice onion. Cut chicken into strips.
2.	 Clean the potatoes, I don’t peel them, but you can if you 
don’t like the skin. Cut the potatoes into french fries and then 
again into bite-size cubes. 2x2 cm or 1x1 inch.
3.	 If you have a microwave place the potatoes in a container  
and microwave for 5 minutes.
4.	 Place a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on a stove on medium-high.  
Add oil and fry the chicken on one side for 60 seconds.  
Add a pinch of salt and black pepper.
5.	 Flip the chicken and fry the other side for 60 seconds.  
Don’t cook the chicken through; just look for color.
6.	 Remove the chicken, add again 2 g oil into the pan and add 
the potatoes. If you microwaved them, fry them for 5-6  
minutes until golden brown. If you add them raw, switch the 
heat to medium and close the lid and fry them for 12-15  
minutes under occasional stirring.
7.	 When the potatoes are almost ready,  
add in the onion and keep frying for 2-3 minutes. 
8.	 Add frozen vegetables with a splash of water, switch the heat 
to high, close the lid and wait for 2 minutes until the vegeta-
bles are thawed. Add another pinch of salt and black pepper.
9.	 Remove the lid, keep frying until the water is evaporated  
and add in the chicken back for 30 seconds while mixing 
everything.
10.	Add the egg, mix it and keep frying for 30 seconds 
until the egg is cooked. Done!
