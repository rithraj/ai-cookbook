HOMEMADE
COTTAGE CHEESE
I N G R E D I E N T S :
1,000 g 		
skimmed milk
40 g 	
	
white vinegar
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Add milk to a pot on medium heat.  
Bring the milk up to a temperature of 90°C or 
200°F. That’s just below a simmer.
2.	 Now add the vinegar and whisk the milk.
3.	 Now remove the pot from the heat,  
close the lid and let it rest for 20 minutes.
4.	 Now you need a cheesecloth and a bowl.  
Put the cheesecloth into a bowl, and add the  
entire liquid from the pot into the cheesecloth.  
You will be left with cottage cheese in the  
cheesecloth and liquid whey in the bowl.
5.	 Throw out the whey. Put the cheese from the 
cheesecloth on a plate and let it cool down. 
6.	 Your cottage cheese is ready!
N O T E S :
•	Calories are noted per 100g of cottage  
cheese because it’s not that easy to say  
how much cheese will be left after  
removing the whey.
