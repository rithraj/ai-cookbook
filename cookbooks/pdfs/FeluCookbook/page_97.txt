D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Slice the beef into thin strips. Optional marinate it like in 
the chapter „Washing and marinating meat to tenderi-
ze“. If not then proceed with the recipe.
2.	 Chop up onion and cabbage. Combine in a glass soy 	
	
	
sauce, gochujang, cornstarch, and honey.
3.	 Add oil into the pan (24cm/9,5inch) on medium heat. 
Add the onion and the cabbage with a small pinch of 
salt and fry for 4-5 minutes.
4.	 Make space in the pan, add oil and then the beef. 	
	
	
Separate the beef and fry one side for 1 minute. Season 	
	
with black pepper and garlic powder. 
5.	 Flip the beef and fry the other side for 1 more minute.
6.	 Give everything a stir before adding the sauce with a 
splash of water and let it simmer for 30 seconds until 
thick.
7.	 Spread the cream cheese on the tortilla, followed up by 
the beef mixture and roll into a burrito shape.
8.	 Give the pan a clean up and place burrito back to the 
pan. Toast all 4 sides for 30 seconds each, done!
N O T E S :
•	You can also add more spices like cumin or onion powder.
•	Reduce the gochujang if it‘s too spicy.
