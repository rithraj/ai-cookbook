SCAMPI  
SAUCE
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Remove Shirataki from the package and rinse it under cold 
water for 30 seconds until the entire liquid is washed away.  
Let the shirataki sit in the sink until the end of the recipe. 
2.	 Cut tomatoes into halves. Peel and grate garlic.
3.	 If you buy frozen prawns, fill up a bowl with cold water,  
add in the frozen prawns and let them sit on the counter  
for 10-15 min. They will be ready to be cooked later.
4.	 Add gochujang, cornstarch and water into a glass  
and mix until smooth.
5.	 Add oil to a pan (24cm/9.5inch) and fry the prawns  
for 60-90 seconds on each side.
6.	 Remove the prawns and add in garlic with another touch of oil 
and fry the garlic, scraping the pan gently for 20 seconds.  
Add in tomatoes and gochujang-water. Stir everything,  
close the lid and let it simmer on medium heat for 4-5 min.  
Add a splash of water if the sauce is too thick.  
Remove the lid and keep simmering for another  
2-3 minutes until the sauce turns creamy. 
7.	 Add the prawns back to the pan and combine everything.  
Remove everything from the pan to a separate plate.
8.	 Add in the shirataki noodles, and dry fry them until the liquid 
has evaporated, around 2 minutes.
9.	 Add in back prawn sauce and combine everything.  
Top with basil or parsley. Done! 
N O T E S :
•	 Prawns can be swapped for chicken breast.
