OVEN ROASTED CHICKEN THIGHS
& VEGETABLES
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
200 g 	 	
skinless,  
	
	
boneless chicken thighs
250 g 	 	
cauliflower
1 	
	
medium onion or 50 g
1

1 	
	
red bell pepper or 150 g

garlic powder 
2 g 	
	
dry rosemary 
2 g 	
	
dry basil
5 g

Salt and black pepper
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Preheat oven to 200°C or 400°F.
2.	 Cut chicken into bite-size pieces.
3.	 Cut all vegetables into bite-size pieces.
4.	 Add chicken and vegetables to a baking dish.  
Add oil on top of everything. Add seasoning and 
mix very well.
5.	 Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes. Done!
N O T E S :
•	I would recommend making the avocado cream 
cheese dip (see chapter) to dip the chicken and 
veggies in.
•	Don’t worry about overcooking chicken thighs,  
it’s way harder to overcook them than the breast.
