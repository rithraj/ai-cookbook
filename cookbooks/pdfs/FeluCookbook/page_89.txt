PARM
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start with dry brining the chicken breast if you choose 
to (see chapter on Brining chicken)
2.	 For 1 serving, I use only 1 plate. Put it on a scale. 
3.	 Add flour to the plate and then the chicken.  
Cover the entire chicken. 
4.	 Add egg whites to the plate. Coat the chicken with it. 
Last is to add panko to the same plate and again  
cover the chicken.
5.	 Add the coated chicken breast on top of parchment 
paper on a baking sheet and bake it in the oven for  
12-15 minutes, depending on the thickness  the  
chicken breast. Use a thermometer to be safe  
(72°C or 160°F should be aimed for). Alternatively use 
the air fryer.
6.	 In the meantime, cut the mozzarella into small pieces 
and prepare the sauce. I don’t bother making my own 
for one serving because you will need only 50g of sauce.
7.	 Remove the chicken from the oven. Spread sauce on top 
the chicken, so the surface is fully covered (only the top 
side of the chicken). Add mozzarella on top and then 
bake it again under the broiler for 2-3 minutes  
until the cheese has melted.
N O T E S :
•	You can use shredded mozzarella if you can’t  
find the fresh, wet version. In that case, use 30 g only.
