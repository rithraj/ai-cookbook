SPICY
CHICKEN
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Remove shirataki from the package and rinse it under 
cold water for 30 seconds until the entire liquid is  
washed away. Let the shirataki sit in the sink until the 
end of the recipe. 
2.	 Chop up the onion and cut the chicken into small strips. 
3.	 Peel and grate ginger and garlic. Add all the ingredients 
for the sauce into a small glass and stir until smooth.
4.	 Add oil to a pan (24cm/9.5inch) on medium-high  
heat and fry chicken on one side for 1 minute.
5.	 Add the onions and flip the chicken and fry again  
for another 1-1:30 min until everything has color.
6.	 Remove the chicken and onion from the pan.
7.	 Add in the shirataki noodles, and dry fry them until  
the liquid has evaporated around 2 minutes.
8.	 Add in chicken and onion, and mix everything well  
before adding the sauce.
9.	 Keep stir-frying for another minute, and you’re done!
N O T E S :
•	The smell of dry fried shirataki can be a bit off putting  
but don’t worry, you won’t taste it later on.
