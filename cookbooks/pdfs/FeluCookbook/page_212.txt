D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Place a bowl on your scale.
2.	 Add all ingredients to the bowl.
3.	 Mix everything until smooth.
4.	 Refrigerate overnight. 
5.	 Done! Now wasn’t that easy as pie!
N O T E S :
•	You can use Whey but if you do, then use less water. 
Casein will give you a creamier oatmeal!
•	Try to use unsweetened applesauce, or this  
recipe might be too sweet for the morning.
•	Fresh apples as a topping work very well.
