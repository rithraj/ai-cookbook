D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Add eggs, gochujang, cottage cheese, and black 	 	
	
pepper to a blender and blend on high for 30 	
	
	
seconds. Distribute the eggs into 2 containers 	
	
	
(12x18cm or 5x7 inches) and bake at 200°C (400°F) 	
	
for 17-20 minutes.
2.	 In a bowl, combine ground beef, onion powder, 	 	
	
garlic powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Mix 	
	
until combined. Place the bowl on a scale and 	
	
	
form 8 meatballs, each weighing 75g, 	
	
	
	
then place them on a plate.
3.	 Open the McMuffins and lay them on a baking 	
	
	
sheet. As soon as the eggs are ready, remove them 	
	
from the oven and place the McMuffins under the 	
	
broiler for 2 minutes.
4.	 Cut the eggs into 8 rectangles. Place an egg 	
	
	
rectangle on top of each McMuffin and add 1 slice 	
	
of American cheese on top of each egg.
5.	 Add oil to a pan over medium heat. Add 4 	
	
	
meatballs, gently pressing them flat. Cook for 	
	
	
2 minutes, then flip and cook for another 2 	
	
	
minutes. Place the 4 patties on top of 4 McMuffins 	
	
and top with the upper halves of the McMuffins.
6.	 Repeat the process with the remaining 4 	 	
	
	
meatballs. Let the 8 McMuffins cool down for 15 	 	
	
minutes.
7.	 Transfer them to a ziplock bag and store in the 	
	
	
freezer.
