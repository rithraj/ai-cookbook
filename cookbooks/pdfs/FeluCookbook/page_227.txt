CRISPY AIR FRYER
POTATOES
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
250 g 	 	
mealy potatoes
½ tsp 	 	
baking soda or 3 g
10 g 	
	
salt
2 g 	
	
oil
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Peel and cut the potatoes into  
chunks or thick planks.
2.	 Add 1000g of water into a pot and bring it up to a 
boil. Add salt, baking soda and potatoes and let it 
simmer for 7-10 minutes. The potatoes should start 
to break down.
3.	 Drain the water and add the potatoes into a bowl. 
Add oil. Shake the bowl roughly, so the  
potatoes are covered with oil, around 30 seconds.  
The bottom of the bowl should build a  
potato slurry.
4.	 Air fry the potatoes for 20-25 minutes at 200°C  
or 400°F. Shake the basket every 5-7 minutes,  
so the potatoes don’t stick.
5.	 After air frying, add seasoning like pepper,  
cayenne, or garlic powder. Done!
N O T E S :
•	Mealy potatoes will give you the best result,  
but you can also use waxy potatoes.
•	Mealy potatoes are russet, waxy are red bliss.
