D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by preheating a pan to medium  
heat and adding oil.
2.	 Then start by placing a bowl on your scale.  
Add all dry ingredients to the bowl and  
whisk until combined.
3.	 Then add the wet ingredients and whisk 
again until smooth.
4.	 Add 2 servings to the pan and close the lid. 
5.	 After around 2-3 minutes there should be  
bubbles starting to escape from the top of the 
pancake. That’s your sign to flip them over.  
Keep cooking the other side with a closed  
lid for another 2 minutes. 
6.	 Repeat one more time. The batter should give  
you about 4-5 medium-sized pancakes. Done!
N O T E S :
•	It taste so good and with a serving of powdered 
peanuts on top or greek yogurt and blueberries,  
it’s even better!
