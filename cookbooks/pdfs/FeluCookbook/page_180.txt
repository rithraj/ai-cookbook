D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by grinding the oats up in a blender for  
60 seconds until it becomes oat flour.
2.	 Place a bowl on a scale. Add the oat flour, casein, salt, 		
	
and baking soda, and mix.
3.	 Add the remaining ingredients and mix again.
4.	 Line a baking dish (18x12 cm or 7x5 inches) with 	
	
	
parchment paper and add the batter. The batter will be 	
	
sticky, like cookie dough.
5.	 Bake for 30–35 minutes at 180°C (350°F).
6.	 After baking, remove the cake from the baking dish and 	
	
let it cool for 30 minutes.
7.	 Cut and enjoy. The blondies will keep in the fridge for 
2–3 days. 
N O T E S :
•	
You can add 1-2 tablespoons of cinnamon for extra flavor.
•	
These blondies are delicious with whipped cream and/or 	
	
vanilla ice cream.
•	
Great breakfast topped with greek yogurt.
