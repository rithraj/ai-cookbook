D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by peeling the potatoes. 
2.	 Cut the potatoes into thick slices, then into fries and 
then again into bite-size cubes. 2x2cm or 1x1 inch.
3.	 Microwave the potatoes in a bowl for 5 min at 600W.
4.	 In the meantime, dice the onion. Crack the eggs into a 		
	
bowl and season with salt and black pepper.
5.	 Set a pan on the stove over medium-high heat. Pour oil 	
	
into the pan, then add the microwaved potatoes and 	 	
	
diced onions. Fry for around 3-4 minutes, stirring 	
	
	
occasionally, until they are lightly browned.
6.	 Add cayenne pepper and garlic powder, then mix well. 	
	
Add the eggs, switch the heat to medium, gently stir, 	 	
	
cover with a lid, and let it cook for 3 minutes.
7.	 Remove the lid, place a plate on top of the pan, and 	
	
	
carefully flip the entire tortilla. Slide it back into the pan 	
	
with the uncooked side facing down, and cook for 	
	
	
2 more minutes.
8.	 Remove the spanish tortilla and enjoy!
N O T E S :
•	You can swap out some of the whole eggs for egg whites  
only to reduce calories further. I’d recommend 50 g egg  
whites for each whole egg removed.
•	This dish tastes great with a bit of light mayo as a dip.
