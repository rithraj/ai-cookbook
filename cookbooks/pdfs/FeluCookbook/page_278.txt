D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Dice the onion. Peel the garlic and  
cut it into small pieces. 
2.	 Remove the florets from the broccoli.  
Peel potatoes and cut them into smaller pieces.
3.	 Fill a pot with 2000g of water. Add a strong pinch of salt. 
Bring it up to a boil on high heat and add in the  
potatoes. Let them cook for 5 minutes.
4.	 Add the broccoli and let them cook for another  
5 minutes with the potatoes.
5.	 Meanwhile, add oil to a pan on medium heat, add in 
the onions and fry them for 3 minutes under occasional 
stirring. 
6.	 Make space in the pan and add another touch of oil and 
add in the garlic. Fry them for 20 seconds until fragrant.
7.	 Remove onions and garlic and transfer them into a food 
processor (a blender works just as well).
8.	 Save 50g of cooking water from the potatoes and  
broccoli. Drain the rest. Add potatoes and broccoli to a 
food processor with onions and garlic. Add the cooking 
water, greek yogurt, black pepper and lemon juice to 
food processor.
9.	 Blend everything until smooth and creamy.  
Taste and add more salt or pepper if needed. Done!
