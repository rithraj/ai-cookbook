starch, and rice vinegar, and mix until well combined.
4.	 In a pan on medium heat, add oil and begin frying the 	 	
	
sliced zucchini with a small pinch of salt for 4 minutes, 	 	
	
stirring occasionally. 
5.	 Add another touch of oil, add the onions, and continue 	
	
frying for another 3 minutes.
6.	 Push the vegetables to the side of the pan, add another 	
	
touch of oil, and add in the beef. Try to spread it with 	 	
	
your spatula. Fry one side for 1 minute before flipping 	 	
	
the meat.
7.	 Now add in the sauce, mix everything together, close 	 	
	
the lid, and let it simmer for 1 minute.
