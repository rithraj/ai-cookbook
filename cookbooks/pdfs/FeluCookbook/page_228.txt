CAULIFLOWER
RICE
I N G R E D I E N T S  F O R  1  S E R V I N G :
50 g 	
	
raw rice
100 g 	 	
cauliflower rice or florets
100 g 	 	
water
Pinch	  	
salt 
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 If you only have access to a whole cauliflower,  
then cut off the florets until you have 100g and 
then grate them into rice shape on a box grater.
2.	 Add to a pot, rice, cauliflower rice, water and salt. 
3.	 Put the pot on top of a stove on high.  
As soon water starts boiling, reduce the  
heat to low and let it simmer for 12-15 minutes. 
Done!
N O T E S :
•	I like to eat rice and cauliflower instead  
cauliflower only, but you can totally just  
eat cauliflower rice on its own.
