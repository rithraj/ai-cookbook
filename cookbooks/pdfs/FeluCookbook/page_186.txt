BOSTON CREAM
DONUTS
W A T C H  V I D E O
 Probably the most famous donuts 
 but with a ton of protein. 
ESTIMATED TIME: 40 MIN
D I R E C T I O N S :
1.	 Start by grinding the oats in a blender for about 60 	
	
seconds until they become oat flour
2.	 Place a bowl on a scale and add all the dry 	
	
	
ingredients. Then, use a second bowl on the scale to 	
	
combine all the wet ingredients, mixing well until 	
	
they are thoroughly combined.
3.	 Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ones, 
whisking slowly until the mixture is nice and smooth. 
Add a small splash of water if the mixture is too thick.
4.	 Next, transfer the batter into six ramekins (each 
8cm/3 inches) and bake at 160°C (320°F) for 16-20 
minutes.
5.	 In a separate bowl, mix instant pudding mix with milk 	
	
and whisk using an electric mixer until thick. Then, 	
	
add casein and continue mixing until the mixture 	
	
becomes even thicker.
6.	 In another bowl, combine all the frosting ingredients 	
	
and mix well.
7.	 Once the donuts are baked, remove them from the 	
	
ramekins and cut them in half. Create a small crater 	
	
in each half. Fill all the donuts with the filling and top 	
	
them with frosting. Done!
N O T E S :
•	
Whey/Casein blend would work best in this recipe.
•	
Add a bit of water if the batter is dry.  
That is because of the casein.
•	
Muffin tins can be used as an alternative if you don’t 	
	
have ramekins.
