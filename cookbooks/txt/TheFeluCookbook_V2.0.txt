Stop making excuses - just do it!
So, you decided to take responsibility over your health, that is awesome and buying this book is already a huge step towards your goal.
Let me tell you about my personal story real quick. In 2019 I was a very lazy and overweighed person. I did 0 fitness and had the worst possible diet. From one day to another I changed my entire life. I went to the gym every single day, stopped drin- king alcohol and started to have a healthier diet by rediscovering again my LOVE for cooking.
Once I discovered that you can make fun food and still lose weight I decided to create a Youtube channel and later make this book. My mission is to show you that fat loss doesn't have to be boring. You don't need to eat plain chicken and broccoli or go on a low carb diet.
You need to have a diet that is sustainable for the rest of your life so you can lose weight and keep it off FOREVER.
This cookbook will certainly be a help for you to find fun recipes that you enjoy for the rest of your life.
I wish you all the best, Felu

FAQ ABOUT THIS BOOK PLEASE READ
HOW TO USE THIS BOOK?
Every chapter and recipe in this book is clickable, making it easy to navigate through the book and discover all the recipes. You can also navigate back. On the right side on every recipe page is a bar. Above the bar is your way back to all chapters by clicking on THE FELU COOKBOOK. Below is the way back to all recipes in the respective chapter by clicking on the word the- re. 0 scrolling is needed in this book. A lot of recipes have a play symbol on the page that will lead you to the youtube video that shows everything if you don't understand the written directions.
WILL I AUTOMATICALLY LOSE WEIGHT WHEN EATING THE RECIPES FROM THIS BOOK?
To lose weight, you need to create a caloric deficit. No diet can guarantee this, but using my cookbook will make it more likely to achieve a caloric deficit because the recipes are lower in calories and higher in protein, which can help you feel full for longer.
ARE THE BAKING TIMES PRECISE?
No, they are heavenly influenced by the size and depth of your baking dish, the material of the dish, your oven and even the alti- tude where you live. I have noted down the time it takes my oven to bake each recipe, but if you don't use the same size dish your baking time will alter. As a general rule of thumb. If your dish is deeper, the baking time will be shorter. And if your dish is narro- wer than mine, your baking time will usually increase as the heat needs more time to penetrate the mixture. So please, make sure to check your cake, if possible with a food thermometer when baking and adjust the time accordingly. My baking recipes are developed with the baking dishes that I own. If you don't have the same sizes you need to adjust the time in the oven accor- dingly.
WHY SOME RECIPES USE WHEY PROTEIN POWDER AND OTHERS CASEIN?
Well, whey and casein protein powder are completely different in texture and so will give a different baking result.
Whey protein powder tends to rise properly but can often be dry, since it can't hold a lot of water. On the other hand casein powder creates juicy dishes, but it doesn't rise at all when baked. That's why for some recipes it's better to use one or the other or both combined.

FAQ ABOUT THIS BOOK PLEASE READ
I DON'T LIKE SHIRATAKI NOODLES, CAN I STILL USE THE RECIPES IN THE SHIRATAKI CHAPTER?
Yes, absolutely, you can use the exact same recipe and simply replace shirataki either with rice or with udon noodles. You can also make the recipe with vegetables or potatoes, depending on your personal preference. Remember, when it comes to baking, there are no right or wrong answers; it's all about being creative and experimenting in the kitchen.
DO I NEED SPECIAL KITCHEN TOOLS?
What I would strongly recommend investing in, if you don't already have one, is a kitchen scale. But apart from the scale, most recipes don't need any additional kitchen tools except for a few where you need a blender. I would also suggest buying a 24 cm non-stick pan with a lid. This is the perfect size to make all of the recipes in this book.
CAN I MAKE YOUR BAKING DISHES IN MY AIR FRYER?
Absolutely. You can make each and every recipe outlined in this book that needs to be baked in the oven by using an air fryer. Just subtract 20℃ from the temperature I have used to bake in an air fryer.
HOW IS EVERYTHING WEIGHED OUT?
All weights and calories are measured using the raw ingredients.
WHICH OIL SHOULD I USE?
I use olive oil for everything I make and have never had a bad experience in doing so. I find using olive oil spray bottles is the easiest method! You can find them on Amazon for a reasona- ble price. Don't add oil without measuring it if you don't have a spraybottle, you will need way more calories than you might think.

FAQ
vkack28@gmail.com 13 Mar 2025
FAQ ABOUT THIS BOOK PLEASE READ
WHY ARE SPICES IN GRAMS AND NOT IN TEASPOONS?
Because teaspoons and tablespoons have different measure- ments in different countries. For example the teaspoon in the US is about 30% bigger than in the EU. You need to measure the spices once and then you can start using teaspoons for spices going forward.
WHICH SOY SAUCE SHOULD I USE?
Personally, I would buy one light soy sauce and one low-sodium version. However, you can try my recipes with both and adjust them depending on how salty you prefer the meal. Just remem- ber that if you add light soy sauce, never add additional salt. And if you use low-sodium soy sauce, then you might need a pinch of salt. Also, you can always swap out soy sauce with water and make it 50/50 to thin it out a bit.
WHY DO YOU HAVE ODD NUMBERS SOMETIMES LIKE 180g OF GROUND BEEF?
My recipes are developed with ingredients I can get at my local groceries. Ground beef for example gets sold in 180 g packages, if you have other sizes like 226 g or half a pound it's no big deal, just adjust the calories accordingly. Altering ingredients by 10-20% is usually no big deal and won't destroy a recipe.
WHICH PROTEIN POWDER SHOULD I BUY?
For optimal results, it is recommended to use both a whey and a casein protein powder, but you can also consider a blend of both whey and casein. Vanilla flavor is the most versatile. If you only have access to whey, the recipes will still be effective, but may not be as good as when using a blend.
WHAT DOES GROUND BEEF 95/5 MEAN?
It means 95% meat and 5% fat. If you buy the regular ground beef it will have around 20% fat and thus double the amount of calories.
WHY DOES THIS BOOK NEVER USE CHICKEN WITH SKIN LIKE ON THIGHS?
The skin of chicken contains most of the fat, so removing it can save up to 50% of the calories. While removing the skin may alter the flavor and texture of the chicken, it is a good compro- mise for those looking to reduce their calorie intake while still enjoying dark meat.

FAQ
vkack28@gmail.com 13 Mar 2025
HOW ARE CALORIES MEASURED?
All calories found on food labels are measured in the same way. They are the sum of the calories from the macros written underneath.
There are 3 macros that contribute to the total calories -
CARBOHYDRATES
PROTEINS
FATS
—
—
—
.
1 g = 4 calories
1 g = 4 calories
1 g = 9 calories
Every gram of FAT is measured with 9 CALORIES, and every gram of CARBOHYDRATE and PROTEIN is measured with 4 CALORIES each. So, for example, if an item you buy has 10g of carbs, 5g of protein, and 3g of fat, that means the total sum of calories is 87.
FIBER PLAYS A SEPARATE ROLE WHEN IT COMES TO CALORIES.
The dietary FIBER found in food is in some countries measured as 0 calories and in other countries as 2 calories per gram. That's why on some food labels, you might see net carbs. They subtract the fiber from the carbohydrate, and what remains is net carbs, and get measured with four calories per gram.
That's the reason why my recipes are measured in the exact same way. I have taken all macro entries from the USDA Database and calculated the calories for all my recipes according to them.
So please keep in mind that there will be rounding errors, but that's no big deal. It's impossible to measure the exact amount of calories in each meal anyway, and as long as you take the same entry for every food item every time you eat it, you will be fine over time, even if it's not exact.

COOKING TECHNIQUE

WASHING AND MARINATING MEAT TO TENDERIZE
This technique can be used for every recipe that involves stir frying meat. Alternatively skip this step and proceed with the recipe instructions.
WHAT YOU'LL NEED:
200 g lean meat
1g baking soda
1g cornstarch
2 g
salt
5 g soy sauce
. This technique is used by East Asian-style restaurants to make juicy and tender meat. It works well with chicken breast and lean cuts of beef like sirloin. It's not necessary for chicken thighs.
. First, cut the piece of meat into strips.
· Next, fill a bowl with cold water, and place the meat strips inside the bowl and massage the meat for around one minute.
. Now remove the meat and pop into a strainer over your sink. Press the meat in your hands and squeeze the water out. This will make sure that the marinate will be fully absorbed.
· Place the squeezed meat into a small bowl. Add baking soda, cornstarch, salt and soy sauce.
. Mix until the entire meat is covered.
. Now let it marinate for 15 minutes. This is enough time to see a difference in the texture of the meat.
· Proceed with the recipe instructions.

HOW TO COOK PASTA LIKE A PRO
This technique will give you the most concentrated pasta water that will make every sauce you make even better.
WHAT YOU'LL NEED:
100 g dry pasta
water 500 g
A pinch salt
A pan or small pot
. Most people cook pasta by filling up a large pot with water, adding a pinch of salt, and turning up the heat. Once the water boils, the pasta is added and cooks for around 10 to 12 minu- tes. While this isn't wrong, it does waste a lot of energy, and the pasta water isn't concentrated enough to make a delicious sauce. Since starch is an emulsifier, the pasta water, when concentrated, will make your sauces thick and creamy.
. Instead, add the pasta to a cold pan and fill the pan with water until the pasta is covered. About 500g water in a 24 cm or 9.5 inch pan will do.
Now add a small pinch of salt and switch the heat to high.
. As the water starts to boil, stir it a couple of times so that the pasta doesn't stick together.
. As soon as the pasta water boils, turn down the heat to medi- um-high, so the water begins simmering. Let the pasta cook for a further 10-12 minutes.
· What you'll be left with is highly concentrated pasta water that will make every pasta dish better.
. Add the pasta water at the end of every recipe into the sauce and stir while the pan is still hot. Enjoy!

HOW TO COOK A JUICY CHICKEN BREAST
The first 3 Steps can be used for every recipe that involves Chicken Breast. Or feel free to skip this part and proceed with the recipe instructions.
WHAT YOU'LL NEED:
1 chicken breast 1.5 g 1 salt zip lock bag A heavy item such as a pot or a pan
1. Place the chicken breast in a zip lock bag, gently press out the air and close it.
2. Now, take something heavy like a pot or a pan, and start hitting the chicken breast, especially on the thicker side, until everything is even in terms of thickness. This helps to prevent uneven cooking.
3. Place the chicken on a plate and salt both sides evenly. Pop the chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour to dry brine it. You can also prepare it the day before cooking to save yourself some time. This will make the chicken extra tender and juicy too.
4. When you're ready to follow one of my chicken recipes, grill the chicken breast and check with a food thermometer until the interior reaches 70℃ or 160ºF and let it rest for 1 minute. Done!
NOTES :
All 3 steps are essential to make the best possible chicken. However, you can skip the dry brining as long as you flat out the chicken breast and make sure not to overcook it by using a food thermometer throughout the cooking process.
Please note that the first 3 steps are optional for every chicken recipe in this book. And it's not mandatory to follow them, but it will help to optimize every chicken recipe you make moving forward!

HOW TO MAKE SAUCES THICK
There are 2 ways to thicken up a sauce and both work the same way:
. At the end of every sauce, you have two options to make your sauce thicker without increasing the calories of your dish
. Combine cornstarch with cold water in a glass and immediately stir to prevent clumps. Add the cornstarch slurry at the very end of a recipe to the sauce, when it's still hot, and let it simmer for around 30 seconds. It should make your sauce immediately thicker. This will be more of a sticky consistency and is perfect for Asian-style dishes!
· The other way of achieving this is to combine water with dry gelatine and add this when making the sauce and let it sim- mer for around 1 minute. This will make it richer and replicate a mouthful feeling, almost like long braised meat.
· Either way, just wait until the end of a recipe and decide if you need to add a thickener and try both over time so that you start to form a preference between the both.

HOW TO MELT EVERY KIND OF CHEESE
This is where you can become a food scientist.
WHAT YOU'LL NEED:
Any type of cheese that doesn't melt easily
Sodium citrate or American cheese or any type of processed cheese
When adding cheese like fat-free mozzarella on top of your next meal, try to sprinkle a tiny bit of sodium citrate on top of the cheese. This will help it to melt. You can buy sodium citrate on Amazon, or if you don't want to buy this, then you can sim- ply purchase American cheese or any other kind of processed cheese, which will do the job because they have this ingredient integrated.
Now combine your cheese of choice with 1 slice of American cheese and add it into your meal. You'll be pleasantly surprised by how creamy it becomes. This works really well for Mac n Cheese.

DIRECTIONS :
1. Start by chopping up the red pepper and onion into bite-size pieces. Then peel and grate the garlic.
2. Add oil to a pan and heat on a medium heat.
3. Add the pepper and onion to the pan and let them fry gently for around 6-7 minutes until they start to caramelize.
4. Add garlic and fry for 30 seconds and then add all the spi- ces and mix until combined.
5. Next comes the crushed tomatoes with a splash of water and stir everything.
6. Close the lid and let everything simmer for around 10 minutes.
7. Remove the lid and let the tomato sauce reduce for another 5 minutes.
8. Dig 3 holes with a spoon and crack 3 eggs into the holes. Close the lid and cook the eggs for 2-3 minutes, so the yolk is still runny. Done!
NOTES:
· Add diced black olives and parsley as garnish.
. Toast two slices of french baguette in a pan and lay them in a plate as the base to this dish before adding shakshuka on top.
. You can reduce the calories by simply adding less oil, but you will get less caramelization and less flavor.
. You can swap out some of the whole eggs for egg whites only to reduce calories further. I'd recommend 50 g egg whites for each whole egg removed.

3. Cut chicken breast, onion, pepper and carrot into bite size pieces.
4. Preheat a pan to medium-high heat, and add 2g of oil before adding the chicken.
5. Fry chicken on both sides for 60 seconds. Remove it from the pan and place on a plate even if the chicken is not fully cooked.
6. Add 2g of oil again to the same pan. Add in carrot, onion and pepper and fry under occasional stirring for 3-5 minutes.

11. Add the chicken back to the pan with soy sauce and keep frying for 30 seconds until the chicken is hot again. Done!
NOTES:
. After cooking, let the rice sit in the hot pot to remove all the liquid. This will help make the rice less clumpy.
. If you have left over rice the recipe works even better.

3. Take a baking sheet, spray some oil on it, and spread the oil with your hands. Place the dough ball on the sheet and slowly press it down to form a round pizza shape.
4. Lay the larger cheese stick pieces around the edges, leaving a bit of space between them. Roll the edges of the dough towards the center over the cheese sticks to form a stuffed crust.
5. Add tomato sauce to the middle of the dough, and season with salt, black pepper, and oregano. Then add the finely chopped 4th cheese stick and the shredded mozzarella.
6. Bake in the oven at 220℃ or 420ºF for 15-20 minutes. Done!
NOTES :
. You can change up the toppings and use tuna with onions or a vegetabrian pizza for more volume!

3. Add the pasta to a cold pan (I use a 24cm or 9,5 inch pan). Place the pan on top of your stove and cover it with cold water until the pasta is covered. This should take around 500 g.
4. Add a small pinch of salt.
5. Switch the heat to high and immediately start stirring the pasta every 20 seconds for the first 2 minutes.
6. Once the water is boiling, turn the heat to medium-high and cook pasta al dente.
7. In the pan should be a bit of pasta water left. You can remove most of it in a separate glass. But don't throw it away yet!
8. Add in the pan the cheese and gochujang and turn the heat to low. Slowly let everything melt into a thick cheese sauce. Add the pasta water back to the pan if it's too thick. Keep slowly cooking for 2 minutes until fully melted. Done!
NOTES:
· This pasta technique can be used for every pasta dish you make. The pasta water will be highly concentrated in starch, which will make every sauce better.

ESTIMATED TIME: 30 MIN
DIRECTIONS :
1. Start with the washing and marinating first if you choose to do it (see the How to Tenderize Lean Beef chapter). Otherwise, just cut the meat into strips.
2. Clean the potatoes with cold water, I don't peel them. Cut the potatoes into fries. Add them to a baking dish, add oil, and a pinch of salt and mix everything with your hands.
3. Bake the potatoes for 30 min at 200℃ or 400ºF. Flip them halfway through with a spatula. You can also use an air fryer for the potatoes.
4. Chop up all vegetables into equal bite-size pieces. Peel and grate the garlic.
5. Add the beef to a pan (24cm/9,5inch) on medium-high heat. If you don't marinate the beef, you need to add a bit of oil to the pan.
6. Fry the meat for 60 seconds on both sides until they get color.
7. Remove the beef, and add all vegetables except the tomatoes into the pan. You might need to add another touch oil. Fry this under occasional stirring for 7-10 minutes on medium heat.
8. Add in garlic for 15 seconds, and then add in the tomatoes. Add in black pepper, close the lid and let the tomatoes simmer for another 3 minutes.
9. Add in the sauce and the beef and let everything cook for 1 more minute. If you haven't marinated the meat, then you might need to add a bit of starch slurry (mix 50g cold water with 2g corn- starch in a bowl and start adding half in the pan).
10. Potatoes should be ready, so put them on a plate and cover everything with your beef, veggies, and sauce. Top with cilantro or parsley. Done!
NOTES :
· Beef can be swapped out for chicken breast or lean pork.
· Potatoes can be swapped out for rice.

DIRECTIONS :
1. Start with dry brining the chicken breast if you choose to (see chapter on Brining chicken)
2. For 1 serving, I use only 1 plate. Put it on a scale.
3. Add flour to the plate and then the chicken. Cover the entire chicken.
4. Add egg whites to the plate. Coat the chicken with it. Last is to add panko to the same plate and again cover the chicken.
5. Add the coated chicken breast on top of parchment paper on a baking sheet and bake it in the oven for 12-15 minutes, depending on the thickness the chicken breast. Use a thermometer to be safe (72℃ or 160ºF should be aimed for). Alternatively use the air fryer.
6. In the meantime, cut the mozzarella into small pieces and prepare the sauce. I don't bother making my own for one serving because you will need only 50g of sauce.
7. Remove the chicken from the oven. Spread sauce on top the chicken, so the surface is fully covered (only the top side of the chicken). Add mozzarella on top and then bake it again under the broiler for 2-3 minutes until the cheese has melted.
NOTES:
. You can use shredded mozzarella if you can't find the fresh, wet version. In that case, use 30g only.

DIRECTIONS :
1. Chop up the onion into small pieces. Mix all the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl.
2. Form 2 balls out of the beef. 90g each. Salt and pepper both.
3. In a big pan, cast iron works best, add 2 g of oil on medium- high heat. Start with frying the onions for 1-2 minutes.
4. Now heat up the pan to high and add both beef balls. Place 1 parchment paper over each beef ball. Take a spatula and something heavy like a glass bottle and press both patties down. The parchment paper will prevent the beef from sticking to the spatula. You can press the patty down with the spatula only, but something heavy will help on top of the spatula.
5. Fry 1 side of the beef for 30-45 seconds, and flip the beef by scraping the bottom of the patty. If it sticks, you've done it right!
6. Place a slice of american cheese on top of 1 patty after flipping.
7. Add a little splash of water to the side of the pan and close the lid. The steam will help melt the cheese.
8. Add both sides of the bun to the pan and toast them for 15 seconds.
9. Assemble burger. With the first bun, add sauce, then patties, then the onion, then again sauce and top the bun. Done!
NOTES :
· A cast iron pan will work best and will develop a nice crust on the patty.

DIRECTIONS:
1. Start by preheating the oven to 200℃ or 400°F.
2. Cut the squash into halves. Use a sharp knife and do it slowly. The shell might be hard to cut at first.
3. Remove the seeds with a spoon. Add salt and pepper on top of both squash halves. Put the squash with the open side looking down on a baking sheet and put it in the oven for 45-60 minutes.
4. In the meantime, chop up onions, and peel and grate garlic.
5. Slice the sausage into halves lengthwise and remove the skin. Chop up the sausage into bite-size pieces.
6. Heat up a pan (24cm/9,5inch) to medium heat with oil. Add in onions and the sausage and let it fry for 4-5 minutes. The fat of the sausage will render out and will caramelize the onions.
7. Add the garlic and keep frying for 20 seconds. Add a pinch of salt and black pepper. Add crushedd tomatoes, add a splash of water, stir everything, close the lid and let it simmer for 10 minutes.
8. After 10 minutes, add in the bunch of basil, stir the sauce, and it's ready.
9. Pull out the squash from the oven. Mix the inside of the squash with a fork to get stringy flesh that looks like fine spaghetti. Remove all of the squash and plate onto two plates.

DIRECTIONS :
1. Start by dry-brining the chicken as described in the chapter „How to Cook a Juicy Chicken Breast."
2. After brining, cut the chicken into nuggets. The size of the nuggets will dictate the baking time, with thicker nuggets needing longer in the air fryer or oven.
3. To create the breading, add cornflakes to a ziplock bag and crush them into a rough powder using a heavy pot.
4. Set up three separate bowls containing flour, egg whites, and crushed cornflakes. Dip each piece of chicken into the bowls in that order, making sure that each piece is fully coated with breading.
5. Place the chicken into the air fryer basket and spray some oil on top. Flip the chicken and add another spritz of oil.
6. Set the air fryer to 200℃ or 400°F and cook for 8-12 minutes. Use a food thermometer to ensure that the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 74℃ or 165°F to be safe.

DIRECTIONS :
1. Start by placing a bowl on a scale.
2. Add all ingredients except the toppings.
3. Mix until creamy and smooth for 30 seconds. Using casein is important but not mandatory, so don't worry if you haven't got it. You can also add whey but it won't be as creamy and thick even after refrigerating.
4. Cover the bowl and refrigerate overnight.
5. In the morning, peel and slice a banana. Roughly chop up the walnuts. Top with the oats.
6. You're done! Breakfast is served!
NOTES :
· Milk can be used instead of water, but please track the additional calories.
· To lower calories, you can add strawberries as a topping instead of the banana and nuts.
· Powdered peanuts can be replaced with 10 g of regular peanut butter.
· Steelcut oats can be used instead of instant oats which will result in a crunchier texture.

2. Add all dry ingredients and mix well.
3. Next add peanut butter. Alternatively you can add 60g of powdered peanuts.
4. Now you can add the milk and combine everything with a spatula. After 30-60 seconds it should have a thick creamy consistency. If too dry, feel free to add 30 g of water and keep stiring.
5. Place parchment paper onto a baking tray (8 x 22cm or 3x 9 inch).
6. Transfer everything onto the baking sheet.
7. Now bake at 180℃ or 350°F for 20-25 min.
8. After baking, remove the oatbar and place it on a plate to cool for around 20 minutes.
9. Finally, cut into 6 equal sized bars. They will last in the fridge for about 2-3 days.
NOTES :
· Casein protein powder works best for this recipe. If you add whey protein you might have to use less water. Also with whey it can be a bit dry so I would also advise adding in a banana.
. You can add 25g of sweetener if the protein powder you want to use isn't sweet enough.

DIRECTIONS :
1. Preheat the oven to 180℃ or 350ºF. Then start by placing a bowl on your scale.
2. Taste the yogurt before adding it, just to see if you need sweetener in the cake.
3. Add 25g sweetener into the bowl if needed. Then add in the yogurt, egg, and pudding powder and mix until smooth. You can choose whatever flavor you want, I tend to make it with strawberry yogurt and vanilla pudding or vice versa.
4. Add parchment paper to a baking dish. (15cm or 6inch diameter).
5. Transfer the batter to the baking dish and bake in the oven for 30-35 min.
6. Remove and place the cake on a plate to allow it to cool for 15 mins. Refrigerate the cake for 1 hour or until it has set. Overnight is also an option.
7. Top with one serving powdered peanuts. Done!
NOTES :
. This can be meal prepped for 3-5 days.
. If you have only access to plain yogurt add 1/2 scoop of protein powder to add extra flavor.
. You can make a bigger cake by doubling or even tripling the ingredients. However, I would reduce the baking temp to 160℃ or 320°F and prolong the baking by 10-15 minutes.
· You can use 50 g egg whites instead 1 whole egg to save 50 calories.

DIRECTIONS:
1. Chop all onions into bite-sized pieces. Add crushed tomatoes with salt, pepper, oregano, onion powder and garlic powder into a container.
2. Preheat a pan (28cm or 11 inch) to medium-high heat and add in oil. Start with frying ground beef. Spread it out with a spatula and wait for 2 minutes until the bottom has developed color.
3. Add salt and pepper.
4. After 2-3 mins, add in onions and mix everything and keep frying for 2-3 minutes. The onions will become translucent.
5. Add in crushed tomatoes and combine everything. Keep cooking for another 2-3 minutes.
6. Add laughing cow wedges and incorporate them into the meat with a spatula by pressing them down. The sauce will slowly become orange and creamy.
7. Add mozzarella and mix until the cheese is fully melted. Place a big plate on a scale. Transfer the meat to that plate and remember the weight. Try to press the meat down, so it becomes flat. Put it into the fridge to cool down for 20 minutes. This will help prevent the burrito from becoming soggy.
8. Now place the meat plate on a scale. Take out 1 tortilla. Divide your remembered weight from before by 6. Take out this number from the meat plate and spread it on top of the tortilla. Try to cover the lower third the tortilla and leave a bit of space around the edges.
9. Flip both sides left and right toward the middle of the tortilla. Now rolling from the bottom upward, make a burrito shape. Wrap it tight into aluminum foil. Done.
10. Repeat with all tortillas. Add them into a ziplock back and freeze them for up to 3 months.
11. The quickest way to defrost them is in a microwave. Remove them from the aluminum foil and place them on a plate. Microwave for 260W or defrost setting for 7 minutes and then switch to 620W for another 3-4 minutes. Ready!

6. Add cumin, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper, and mix everything for 30 seconds.
7. Now add the eggs and cook them for about 1 minute until they are cooked through.
8. Transfer everything onto 2 plates to cool down for 15-20 minutes. If you wrap them now, the burritos will become soggy.
9. Meanwhile, make the mint sauce (see chapter).
10. Prepare 5 tortillas. Separate everything from the pan evenly, add 15g of mozzarella on top of each tortilla, and add 5g of mint sauce per tortilla as well. Wrap the tortillas into 5 burritos, then cover them with a paper towel and put them into a zip-lock bag. Store them in the freezer for up to 3 months.
11. When ready to eat, take them out of the freezer and microwave for 3-4 minutes. They will be ready to enjoy!

DIRECTIONS :
1. Place a big bowl in the fridge, so it starts to cool down.
2. Prepare aromatics. I highly recommend using lemongrass and ginger. Cut the lemongrass stem into 3 big pieces and peel the ginger.
3. Add water with dry gelatine into a small glass and mix with a spoon until combined. Set it aside.
4. Add the heavy cream and milk into a pot on medium heat, and also add the lemongrass and ginger. Let it slowly heat up until it simmers, around 6-8 minutes.
5. As soon it starts simmering, take it off the heat and let it rest for 10 minutes, so the aromatics release their flavor.
6. After 10 minutes, remove the lemongrass and ginger and add the gelatine to the pan of milk and cream.
7. Add a pinch of salt and whisk everything until gelatine is incorporated and dissolved, 20 seconds.
8. Take the bowl from the fridge and add in Skyr. Then add the mixed cream, milk, and gelatine mixture and start whisking everything until combined and smooth.
9. Keep the bowl on your counter for 5 more minutes under occasional stirring so the fat and water won't separate.
10. Distribute the Panna Cotta into 5 containers and refrigerate them for at least 2 hours until it is completely hard. Now you're ready to serve!
NOTES :
. This can be stored in the fridge for 3-5 days.
· Add toppings after refrigeration, such as peanut butter or microwaved fruit.

I have personally found that if the ingredient label doesn't contain the ingredient "Calcium hydroxide" also known as pickling water, it's a good choice. So even though this is no guarantee, it's worth a try!

4. Switch the heat to medium-high and add the beef. Try to separate the beef with a spatula, so as much beef as possible gets in contact with the pan. Fry the beef for 2 minutes.
5. Add ginger and garlic with another touch of oil and keep frying for 20 seconds.
6. Add Gochujang and Miso paste. Stir everything and add the water. Now let the broth simmer for 5 minutes on medium-low heat.
7. Meanwhile, heat up a pan to medium-high without any oil. Add the shirataki noodles and dry fry them for 4-5 minutes until the entire water is evaporated.
8. Transfer shirataki into the pot with the ramen and let it cook for one additional minute. Done!
NOTES:
. You can top the ramen with spring or/and pickled onions. Add a soft-boiled egg to enhance this dish even further.
· Swap out shirataki for ramen noodles for the real deal.
